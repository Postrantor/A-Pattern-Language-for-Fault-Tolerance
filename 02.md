# CHAPTER 2

# Fault Tolerant Mindset

The previous chapter defined the basic vocabulary and the four phases of fault tolerance. This chapter will look at techniques to design for fault tolerance and enhanced reliability and availability.

> 上一章定义了基本词汇和容错的四个阶段。本章将介绍设计容错和增强可靠性和可用性的技术。

# _Fault Tolerant Mindset_

What can go wrong in any given situation? That is a key question to anyone trying to develop fault tolerant software. Thinking to ask the question and define the solution is called having a _Fault Tolerant Mindset_. In almost any situation something can go wrong. A fault tolerant program is prepared for these errors. Asking what-if questions and planning during design for the errors that _might_ happen during execution are the hallmarks of the Fault Tolerant Mindset. What if the stack pointer becomes negative? What if the wrong subclass is instantiated? What if the message arrives out of order?

> 在任何给定的情况下，什么会出错？对于任何试图开发容错软件的人来说，这是一个关键问题。思考提出问题并定义解决方案称为拥有“容错心态”。在几乎任何情况下，都可能出现问题。为这些错误准备了容错程序。在设计过程中，针对执行过程中发生的错误提出问题并进行规划，这是容错思维的特点。如果堆栈指针变为负值怎么办？如果实例化了错误的子类怎么办？如果消息到达时出现问题怎么办？

Applying a Fault Tolerant Mindset to all stages of software development is beneficial. This includes both during requirements definition and test development as well as the traditional phases of software creation (architecture, design, coding).

> 将容错心态应用于软件开发的所有阶段是有益的。这包括在需求定义和测试开发期间，以及软件创建的传统阶段（架构、设计、编码）。

# _Design Tradeoffs_

‘Every problem in computer science boils down to tradeoffs’ – Professor L. J. Henschen.

> “计算机科学中的每一个问题都归结为权衡”——L·J·亨森教授。

Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) determine the reliability and availability of a system. These two parameters can be traded off against each other. In some contexts, MTTR is the more important attribute, especially if the system is striving for high availability. Examples include telecommunications systems.

> 平均故障时间（MTTF）和平均修复时间（MTTR）决定了系统的可靠性和可用性。这两个参数可以相互权衡。在某些情况下，MTTR 是更重要的属性，特别是当系统正在努力实现高可用性时。示例包括电信系统。

In other cases the repair time, MTTR, can be long but the MTTF must also be very long. An example is the Space Shuttle, which must perform without failure for the mission duration but once it is on the ground the repair can take more than an instant.

> 在其他情况下，修复时间 MTTR 可能很长，但 MTTF 也必须很长。一个例子是航天飞机，它必须在任务期间无故障运行，但一旦它在地面上，维修可能需要一瞬间以上的时间。

Other systems, such as an ATM banking system, must be failure-free but also highly available. This requires a thorough analysis during the design of the hardware and software components to ensure both high MTTF and low MTTR.

> 其他系统，如 ATM 银行系统，必须是无故障的，但也高度可用。这需要在硬件和软件组件设计期间进行彻底分析，以确保高 MTTF 和低 MTTR。

# _Quality v. Fault Tolerance_

A common misconception is that good quality processes guarantee fault tolerance. This is not necessarily the case. The two ideas are related, but they are distinct from each other.

> 一个常见的误解是，高质量的流程保证了容错性。事实并非如此。这两个想法是相关的，但彼此不同。

Fault tolerance is the ability of the system to execute properly even though there are faults present. Fault tolerance happens at execution time. Saying that a system is fault tolerant says that it was designed in such a way that the system can still behave correctly and not have a failure, even if errors occur during the execution of the system. It also says that a failure will do limited harm

> 容错是指即使存在故障，系统仍能正确执行的能力。容错发生在执行时。说一个系统是容错的，就是说它是这样设计的，即使在系统执行过程中出现错误，系统仍然可以正常运行，不会出现故障。它还说，失败的危害有限

Quality, on the other hand, refers to how fault-free the system is. Quality techniques address ‘how’ the software/system is created. Were code inspections done? Was it fully tested?

> 另一方面，质量指的是系统的无故障程度。质量技术涉及软件/系统的“创建”方式。是否进行了代码检查？它经过充分测试了吗？

A high quality system will have fewer faults than a lower quality system, which in turn results in fewer errors occurring during execution in the higher quality system and hence fewer failures. Reduction in the number of faults present in the system doesn’t imply that the results of the faults are less severe. The system must take steps to reduce the impact of the errors and failures. These steps provide the system with the ability to tolerate the effects of errors.

> 高质量系统将比低质量系统具有更少的故障，这反过来导致在高质量系统中执行期间发生的错误更少，因此故障更少。系统中出现的故障数量的减少并不意味着故障的后果不那么严重。系统必须采取措施减少错误和故障的影响。这些步骤为系统提供了容忍错误影响的能力。

Quality is aimed at preventing faults from entering the system. Reducing the number of faults per line of code (or other unit of measuring a program) is the goal because that will reduce the number of faults that can cause errors. Fault Prevention techniques aim to prevent the addition of faults to the system. Fault Prevention is sometimes considered one of the phases of fault tolerance.

> 质量旨在防止故障进入系统。目标是减少每行代码（或测量程序的其他单位）的错误数量，因为这将减少可能导致错误的错误数量。故障预防技术旨在防止向系统添加故障。故障预防有时被认为是容错的一个阶段。

# _Keep It Simple_

A well known principle of fault tolerant design is that of ‘KIS’, which means ‘Keep It Simple’. Complexity in the system makes it more difficult to ensure correct operation through the design and test processes. Additional complexity requires writing additional software, which for a given density of faults means that there will be more faults present.

> 容错设计的一个众所周知的原则是“KIS”，意思是“保持简单”。系统的复杂性使得通过设计和测试过程确保正确操作变得更加困难。额外的复杂性需要编写额外的软件，对于给定的故障密度，这意味着将存在更多的故障。

In many cases fault tolerant software is ‘good enough’ because to provide the thorough solution would mean adding too much extra code with too much risk of additional faults.

> 在许多情况下，容错软件是“足够好的”，因为提供彻底的解决方案意味着添加太多额外的代码，而有太多额外错误的风险。

One common goal of the Keep It Simple principle is to reduce the number of lines of code dedicated to a task. Fewer lines of code mean fewer latent faults. Instead of designing an elaborate mechanism worthy of a graduate research project, build the simple mechanism that will be easier to maintain, easier to debug, and less likely to contain hidden faults.

> 保持简单原则的一个共同目标是减少任务专用代码行的数量。更少的代码行意味着更少的潜在错误。与其设计一个值得研究生研究项目的复杂机制，不如构建一个更容易维护、更容易调试、更不可能包含隐藏错误的简单机制。

An important aspect of Keep It Simple is to build the right system. Build the system that the specifications call for and don’t add extra features or bells and whistles. The extra code will contain unnecessary faults.

> 保持简单的一个重要方面是建立正确的系统。构建规范要求的系统，不要添加额外的功能或提示。额外的代码将包含不必要的错误。

# _Incremental Additions of Reliability_

Many projects add fault tolerance incrementally. Through continual refinement many small enhancements will have large impacts in fault tolerance. A policy of studying every failure and implementing any design changes that are suggested by analysis is a certain way to improve the system’s fault tolerance.

> 许多项目增加了容错能力。通过不断改进，许多小的增强功能将对容错能力产生巨大影响。研究每一个故障并实施分析建议的任何设计更改的策略是提高系统容错性的某种方式。

For example the 4ESS™ Switch project had a policy to correct every fault that was identified. Every failure that was reported in the field was investigated and tracked back to a fault that could be identified and corrected in the next annual release of software, or sooner if necessary. This effort resulted in a highly reliable system that has been functioning in the US telephone network for over 30 years.

> 例如 4ESS™ Switch 项目有一个策略来纠正识别的每个故障。对现场报告的每一个故障进行了调查，并将其追溯到可以在下一个年度软件版本中识别和纠正的故障，或者在必要的情况下更早。这一努力产生了一个高度可靠的系统，该系统在美国电话网络中运行了 30 多年。

# _Defensive Programming Techniques_

After the basics of the programming language have been mastered, _defensive programming_ techniques should be learned to produce fault tolerant code. Defensive programming builds on the Fault Tolerant Mindset to produce code that defends itself against the potential problems that arise. Programming defensively is done constantly, in every situation, by asking ‘what can go wrong here?’, ‘what errors can occur?’, ‘how might this fail?’, and ‘how can this code be protected from errors in other parts?’.

> 在掌握了编程语言的基础知识之后，应该学习防御编程技术来生成容错代码。防御性编程建立在容错心态的基础上，以生成针对出现的潜在问题进行自我防御的代码。在任何情况下，通过询问“这里会出什么问题？”、“可能会发生什么错误？'，'这怎么会失败，以及“如何保护此代码不受其他部分错误的影响？”。

## Faults in Fault Tolerance Code

Even the software written to perform only fault tolerant related activities can have faults. Given any constant density of faults per line of code, when there are more lines of code there will be more faults. Adding complexity to error handling code increases the risk of adding faults to the software. Keep it Simple!

A related problem is that of accidentally adding faults to a system when trying to repair faults that have caused errors. This complicates the ultimate correction because now the system requires a ‘fix on fix’.

An example: a particular piece of software mysteriously stopped and restarted itself approximately every 24 days. After investigation the problem was determined to be that a counter that was incremented every millisecond became invalid (less than or equal to zero) after this time period and that error triggered the restart. The counter was stored in a 32 bit signed integer. A correction was made and a patch issued to resolve this problem. The system made it past the 24<sup>th</sup> day without incident. It restarted on the 49<sup>th</sup> day. The problem resurfaced. The solution to the previous problem was to make the counter a 32 bit unsigned integer which became invalid (zero) after twice as long. This newly patched software needed a patch. Another lesson from this example is to determine the root cause of the error and to fix it rather than fixing only the symptoms.

Faults in the special software added to ensure fault tolerance might prevent error recovery or mitigation from ever completing successfully.

## Memory Corruption

You should not assume that data storage is always correct. There are many potential errors, from stray writes to bad memory chips to transient errors like alpha particles. Information retrieved from memory should be checked before it is used. This applies whether the memory is long term storage such as a disk or database, or short term such as a message queue. This is especially important when using the information to determine program execution paths.

> 您不应该假设数据存储总是正确的。有很多潜在的错误，从杂散写入到坏的内存芯片，再到像阿尔法粒子这样的瞬时错误。从内存中检索的信息应在使用前进行检查。这适用于内存是长期存储（如磁盘或数据库）还是短期存储（如消息队列）。这在使用信息确定程序执行路径时尤为重要。

For example, a protocol standard defines a message type field in its messages with five valid message types defined in the standard. A three bit field is used to store the message type. A common way to process the message is to use a switch or case statement to branch to the appropriate section of the program. The software designers must ensure that the invalid message types are handled correctly, either by reporting them as an error, taking a default action or discarding the message. There are many reasons why the message might contain an invalid type field: message corruption from a communications line, the memory elements that made up the queue in which the messages was stored might have been faulty, a fault in the software that received and placed the message in the queue might have changed the messages type, etc.

> 例如，协议标准在其消息中定义了一个消息类型字段，其中定义了五种有效的消息类型。三位字段用于存储消息类型。处理消息的常见方法是使用 switch 或 case 语句分支到程序的适当部分。软件设计者必须通过将无效消息类型报告为错误、采取默认操作或丢弃消息来确保正确处理无效消息类型。消息可能包含无效类型字段的原因有很多：来自通信线路的消息损坏、构成存储消息的队列的内存元素可能有故障、接收消息并将其放入队列的软件中的故障可能改变了消息类型等。

Memory leakage is a common potential fault. A common scenario for this is a task acquiring a block of memory which is accessed by a pointer. Then the task terminates without releasing the block of memory that it was allocated. Since the only way to access that block of memory was via the pointer that was local to the task that has terminated, the only pointer to the memory is gone. The memory is unavailable for use. Even if the task that acquired the memory does not terminate holding the only copy of the pointer, subsequent faults might result in the pointer being deleted without the memory being freed for other usage.

> 内存泄漏是常见的潜在故障。一个常见的场景是任务获取由指针访问的内存块。然后任务终止，而不释放分配给它的内存块。由于访问该内存块的唯一方法是通过已终止任务的本地指针，因此该内存的唯一指针已不存在。内存不可用。即使获取内存的任务没有终止保存指针的唯一副本，后续的错误也可能导致删除指针而不释放内存用于其他用途。

Pointers are dangerous because they enable access directly to memory and memory structures without many safeguards. Through the use of pointers, regions of memory can be accessed in ways that they weren’t designed for. This allows great power in the hands of a skilled expert, but also presents the risk of security breaches or mistakes.

> 指针是危险的，因为它们可以直接访问内存和内存结构，而没有很多保护措施。通过使用指针，可以以非设计的方式访问内存区域。这让熟练的专家掌握了巨大的权力，但也带来了安全漏洞或错误的风险。

Another potential problem with pointers is pointers and the regions of memory to which they point are allocated and deallocated independently. Pointers can still be maintained and used, even after the region of memory has been deallocated and possibly reallocated to another task, enabling access to the new task’s memory.

> 指针的另一个潜在问题是指针及其指向的内存区域是独立分配和释放的。指针仍然可以维护和使用，即使在内存区域已被释放并可能重新分配给另一个任务后，也可以访问新任务的内存。

Whenever using pointers, consider how they can be misused or accidentally create problems. Design the use of pointers in the safest possible way.

> 无论何时使用指针，都要考虑它们如何被误用或意外地产生问题。以最安全的方式设计指针的使用。

## Data Structure Design

Data structures should be designed so that they can be _audited_, or checked, for correctness. Audits should check both for correct values and to ensure that the data structure integrity is intact. For example, the check will ensure that impossible data is not stored in a linked list structure and that the list elements are correctly linked.

> 数据结构的设计应使其能够被审计或检查其正确性。审计应检查值是否正确，并确保数据结构完整性完好无损。例如，检查将确保不可能的数据未存储在链接列表结构中，并且列表元素已正确链接。

Data structure design should also support correction of the data. An example of a design for data correction is to include both forward and backward links in important linked lists. This provides redundant connection information and enables a check to ensure that both ends of a link know that they are in fact linked. It also provides enough information to allow the linkage to be reconstructed, if necessary.

> 数据结构设计还应支持数据的更正。数据校正设计的一个示例是在重要的链接列表中同时包含前向和后向链接。这提供了冗余连接信息，并允许进行检查，以确保链接的两端都知道它们实际上是链接的。它还提供了足够的信息，以便在必要时重建链接。

## Design for Maintainability

Fault tolerant systems last a long time. Design them in a way that will make the life of the maintainer easier, because they might not be the initial designer. Use short modules, methods and functions. Make the code readable through the use of white space and comments. Keep the control flow simple because that will be easier to understand and to change if that becomes necessary.

> 容错系统持续时间长。设计它们的方式将使维护人员的生活更轻松，因为他们可能不是最初的设计者。使用简短的模块、方法和函数。通过使用空格和注释使代码可读。保持控制流程简单，因为这将更容易理解，并且在必要时进行更改。

## Coding Standards

Coding standards are another way of improving the quality of software as it is written. Many of the defensive coding techniques just mentioned are best implemented as coding standards. Projects adopt a number of principles that they then use to guide development and to judge the quality of the final code. A principle to remember when dealing with coding standards is this: people cannot remember a large number of things. If a project has 100 standards, it is unlikely that the project members can effectively remember and follow each of them. Having a small number that can be followed and verified will result in higher quality software. And higher quality software means that fewer errors will need to be handled at execution time to ensure fault tolerance.

> 编码标准是提高软件编写质量的另一种方式。刚才提到的许多防御性编码技术最好作为编码标准来实现。项目采用了一些原则，然后他们使用这些原则来指导开发并判断最终代码的质量。处理编码标准时要记住的一个原则是：人们无法记住大量的东西。如果一个项目有 100 个标准，那么项目成员不太可能有效地记住并遵循每一个标准。拥有一个可以跟踪和验证的小数量将产生更高质量的软件。更高质量的软件意味着在执行时需要处理的错误更少，以确保容错性。

## Redundancy

Redundancy is one of the cornerstones of fault tolerance. It will be discussed in the pattern REDUNDANCY (3) in Chapter 4. Redundancy refers to duplicate capabilities in a system which enables for more rapid error recovery and fault treatment. When added to a system to support fault tolerance, redundancy is meant to improve operational quality, not to improve the functionality of the system.

> 冗余是容错的基石之一。这将在第 4 章的冗余模式（3）中讨论。冗余是指系统中的重复功能，可实现更快速的错误恢复和故障处理。当添加到系统以支持容错时，冗余意味着提高操作质量，而不是提高系统的功能。

You can think about redundancy in both time and space dimensions. Time based redundancy can be the sequential execution of different versions of a program followed by a selection, or VOTING (21), of which result to use. Other time based redundancy includes recalculating parameters that don’t change frequently (or ever) to ensure that the parameter value in use is always correct. Space based redundancy is usually implemented by executing a program on different computers. The programs might be identical, or they might be different versions. The different computers are typically located within a cluster, and can be geographically dispersed also.

> 您可以在时间和空间维度上考虑冗余。基于时间的冗余可以是程序的不同版本的顺序执行，然后是选择或投票（21），其结果将被使用。其他基于时间的冗余包括重新计算不经常（或永远）更改的参数，以确保使用的参数值始终正确。基于空间的冗余通常通过在不同的计算机上执行程序来实现。这些程序可能是相同的，也可能是不同的版本。不同的计算机通常位于一个集群内，并且也可以在地理上分散。

## Static Analysis Tools

Tools such as <span class="inlinecode">lint(1)</span> are useful to remove many simple faults during development. Static analysis of program and data structures can detect many problems that would be difficult to detect during development.

> <span class=“inlinecode”>lint（1）</span>等工具对于在开发过程中消除许多简单错误非常有用。程序和数据结构的静态分析可以检测许多在开发过程中难以检测的问题。

## N-Version Programming

With N-Version Programming, NVP, independent development teams use the same specification to generate multiple implementations. During development the design teams are kept separate and do not share their designs, nor do they discuss the specification’s meaning with each other. The design teams should use different algorithms and different programming languages to produce multiple versions that all contain different faults.

> 对于 N 版本编程（NVP），独立开发团队使用相同的规范来生成多个实现。在开发过程中，设计团队保持独立，不共享他们的设计，也不相互讨论规范的含义。设计团队应该使用不同的算法和不同的编程语言来生成包含不同错误的多个版本。

NVP employs redundancy at all levels from design/development to execution. NVP enables parallel execution of computational blocks. A technique discussed in Chapter 4, RECOVERY BLOCKS (4), provides for sequential computation of computational blocks. Serial execution of this parallelism is possible on a uniprocessor as long as there is separation between versions.

> NVP 在从设计/开发到执行的各个层面都采用了冗余。NVP 允许并行执行计算块。第 4 章 RECOVERY BLOCKS（4）中讨论的技术提供了计算块的顺序计算。只要版本之间存在分离，就可以在单处理器上串行执行这种并行。

The fundamental principle of NVP is that there are multiple implementations done by different development teams. The same developer cannot make multiple implementations with multiple understandings of the same specification. The assumption is that when a latent fault activates in one version then the other versions of the system do not contain the same fault. Research by Knight and Leveson \[KL86\]\[KL90\] has shown that the assumption of independence between the faults produced by the different design teams does not hold. Research into NVP continues for example in work by Cai, Lyu and Vouk \[CLV05\].

> NVP 的基本原理是，不同的开发团队有多种实现。同一个开发人员不能在对同一规范有多种理解的情况下进行多个实现。假设当潜在故障在一个版本中激活时，系统的其他版本不包含相同的故障。Knight 和 Leveson\[KL86\][KL90\]的研究表明，不同设计团队产生的故障之间的独立性假设并不成立。例如，Cai、Lyu 和 Vouk\[CLV05\]继续对 NVP 进行研究。

Because of the need for multiple design teams, NVP is not something that an individual or small team can decide on their own to undertake. For this reason, this book does not discuss NVP.

> 由于需要多个设计团队，NVP 不是个人或小团队可以自行决定的。因此，本书不讨论 NVP。

## Redundant Disks \[PGK88\]\[MS00\]

RAID, or ‘redundant array of inexpensive disks’, is a technology for grouping disks together to make a complex that provides redundancy and hence fault tolerance that is unavailable on a single disk. There are five levels of RAID that increase the level of disk redundancy, RAID-1 through RAID-5. An additional level, RAID-0, is an alternate method of writing data to a disk, which does not increase redundancy.

> RAID，或“廉价磁盘冗余阵列”，是一种将磁盘组合在一起的技术，它提供了单一磁盘上不可用的冗余和容错能力。有五个级别的 RAID 可以提高磁盘冗余级别，RAID-1 到 RAID-5。另一个级别 RAID-0 是将数据写入磁盘的另一种方法，不会增加冗余。

RAID works by combining groups of disk drives into a single element. The data is spread over the disks in one of several ways. Disk striping, used by RAID-0, stores consecutive chunks of data spread over a number of disks. This enables parallelism in reading and writing and hence faster access. Disk striping alone does not increase reliability, but it increases performance.

> RAID 的工作原理是将磁盘驱动器组组合成单个元素。数据以多种方式之一分布在磁盘上。RAID-0 使用的磁盘条带化存储分布在多个磁盘上的连续数据块。这实现了读写并行，从而加快了访问速度。单独的磁盘条带化不会提高可靠性，但会提高性能。

Disk mirroring is used by RAID-1. The same data is written to multiple disks simultaneously. It is synchronized between the disks, so that if any of the disks fail there are redundant, identical copies of the data. This increases the reliability of the data with only a small performance increase.

> RAID-1 使用磁盘镜像。同一数据同时写入多个磁盘。它在磁盘之间同步，因此如果任何磁盘出现故障，都会有冗余的、相同的数据副本。这提高了数据的可靠性，但性能仅略有提高。

RAID-2 through RAID-5 all use some form of Hamming or parity encoding to ensure that the stored data can be reconstructed if a disk fails. The differences between these RAID levels is determined by where the data and parity encoding is stored and whether it is striped or mirrored. <a href="#c02.htm#tab2.1" id="c02.htm#tab2.1a">Table 2.1</a> shows how these levels are implemented.

> RAID-2 到 RAID-5 都使用某种形式的 Hamming 或奇偶校验编码，以确保在磁盘出现故障时可以重建存储的数据。这些 RAID 级别之间的差异取决于数据和奇偶校验编码的存储位置以及它是条带化还是镜像 <a href=“#c02.htm#tab2.1”id=“c02.htm#tab2.1a”> 表 2.1</a>显示了如何实现这些级别。

# _The Role of Verification_

Testing and verification are essential to the creation of fault tolerant computing systems because they ensure that fault prevention and quality efforts are successful. Testing and verification also provide the data needed by a project’s software reliability engineers to compute the expected reliability of a system.

> 测试和验证对于创建容错计算系统至关重要，因为它们确保了故障预防和质量工作的成功。测试和验证还提供项目软件可靠性工程师计算系统预期可靠性所需的数据。

A useful kind of testing for fault tolerant systems is operational profile testing. An operational profile describes the usage of the system in quantitative terms and the most typical scenarios that the system will process. This information helps define the most appropriate tests to be run, and how to focus testing efforts. Operational profiles are the scenarios that are used in design, development, and test. To test the reliability and performance of the system the operational profile adds quantitative information to the descriptions of typical scenarios. For more information on operational profiles, refer to Musa et al. \[MFI+96\]

> 容错系统的一种有用的测试是操作配置文件测试。操作概要以量化的方式描述了系统的使用情况，以及系统将处理的最典型场景。这些信息有助于定义要运行的最合适的测试，以及如何集中测试工作。操作概要是设计、开发和测试中使用的场景。为了测试系统的可靠性和性能，操作概要在典型场景的描述中添加了定量信息。有关操作概况的更多信息，请参阅 Musa 等人。\[MFI+96\]

_The Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering_ \[Lyu96\] contains more detailed information about testing and verification for reliability.

> _《软件可靠性工程手册》（Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering_\[Lyu96\]）包含有关可靠性测试和验证的更多详细信息。

# _Fault Insertion Testing_

A technique that is used during the testing and verification phase of a project is fault insertion testing. Testers insert known faults into the system and the system’s behavior is monitored. This testing serves the dual purpose of identifying faults in the system’s error handling processes and of providing data for the computation of coverage factors.

> 在项目的测试和验证阶段使用的一种技术是故障插入测试。测试人员将已知故障插入系统，并监控系统的行为。该测试的双重目的是识别系统错误处理过程中的故障，并为计算覆盖因子提供数据。

Fault insertion testing is the only way that a system’s coverage factor can be determined. Known faults are introduced into the system, which is then observed to see if the system was able to handle the faults automatically. The coverage is computed as the percentage of cases in which recovery was successful.

> 故障插入测试是确定系统覆盖系数的唯一方法。将已知故障引入系统，然后观察系统是否能够自动处理故障。覆盖率以成功恢复的病例百分比计算。

Software fault insertion testing is done by providing erroneous inputs to the system. One way is to alter the normal input to determine the system’s behavior to incorrect values. This is commonly called boundary testing. The next level beyond this is to place ‘hooks’ into the software, or use a debugging tool, to enable internal values and state to be altered.

> 通过向系统提供错误输入来完成软件故障插入测试。一种方法是改变正常输入，以确定系统的行为为不正确的值。这通常称为边界测试。除此之外的下一个级别是将“钩子”放置到软件中，或使用调试工具，以允许更改内部值和状态。

# _Fault Tolerant Design Methodology_

This chapter has discussed a number of aspects of the Fault Tolerant Mindset and has offered some guidelines for creating fault tolerant systems. The following six-step methodology is useful to build upon the Fault Tolerant Mindset and produce a highly available system.

> 本章讨论了容错思维的许多方面，并为创建容错系统提供了一些指导。以下六个步骤的方法对于构建容错心态并生成高可用性系统非常有用。

**1.** The first step is to assess the things that can go wrong with the system. What can go wrong? What are the failures? The technique of _fault trees_ can be useful at this stage. \[Dug95\]

> **1.**第一步是评估系统可能出现的问题。什么会出错？失败是什么？在这个阶段，故障树技术可能很有用\[Dug95\]

**2.** After the risks have been identified, strategies must be defined to mitigate the risks. For each of the potential failures that were identified, how could they be identified and detected before becoming an actual failure? What things could be done in the system to prevent the failures from occurring, and the faults from activating? The project specific pattern language that will be used during design is identified in step 2.

> **2.**在确定风险后，必须确定减轻风险的策略。对于已识别的每一个潜在故障，如何在成为实际故障之前识别和检测它们？在系统中可以采取什么措施来防止故障发生和故障激活？将在设计期间使用的项目特定模式语言在步骤 2 中确定。

**3.** Create a mental model of your system identifying the primary system dividing points and modes of redundancy.

> **3.**创建系统的心理模型，确定主要系统分界点和冗余模式。

**4.** At this point the architectural and major design decisions can be made. These are the ones that influence the whole system. Chapter 4 contains patterns for these high level decisions.

> **4.**此时可以做出建筑和主要设计决策。这些是影响整个系统的因素。第 4 章包含这些高层决策的模式。

**5.** Design in the capabilities for the system to implement the risk mitigation strategies identified in step 2. There are a wide variety of techniques that are presented in Chapters 5 through 8, organized by the four phases of fault tolerance.

> **5.**设计系统实施步骤 2 中确定的风险缓解策略的能力。第 5 章至第 8 章介绍了各种各样的技术，按容错的四个阶段组织。

**6.** Almost all systems, no matter how fault tolerant they are, require some provisions that enable them to be managed and administered by people. Some of these provisions are done inside the design and some aspects relate to the user’s environment and your assumptions about that environment. Designing these human computer interactions and modes of management are important and must be done sensibly to ensure that failures won’t be caused by the people who are trying to administer the system. The techniques for this are not covered in this work. For more information you can look at _Designing Interfaces_ by Tidwell \[Tid05\] or ‘An Input and Output Pattern Language’ \[HS00\].

> **6.**几乎所有系统，无论其容错性如何，都需要一些规定，使其能够由人管理和管理。其中一些规定是在设计中完成的，一些方面与用户的环境和您对该环境的假设有关。设计这些人机交互和管理模式非常重要，必须明智地进行，以确保故障不会由试图管理系统的人员造成。这项工作中没有涉及这方面的技术。有关详细信息，您可以查看 Tidwell\[Tid05\]或“输入和输出模式语言”\[HS00\]的 *Designing Interfaces*。

This methodology is adapted from one in _Secure Coding_, Graff and van Wyk \[GvW03\]. It has been put in terms of fault tolerance and the Fault Tolerant Mindset.

> 该方法改编自 *Secure Coding*、Graff 和 van Wyk\[GvW03\]中的方法。它已被放在容错和容错心态方面。

This methodology will be used in an example problem, to design a fault tolerant Presence Server in the Conclusion.

> 该方法将用于一个示例问题，以在结论中设计一个容错存在服务器。

The benefit of this methodology is that it will get you thinking about what can go wrong with the system. The Fault Tolerant Mindset begins in step 1 where you identify the failures and the risks factors that can cause them. Step 5 comes back to the risks and failures to see if mitigation techniques have been added to the design to cover the risks. Step 2 gives you a chance to think about the risks and the patterns and other techniques that will be useful to mitigate the risks. The pattern language for your project is created in this step. Steps 3 and 4 are where the fault tolerant design starts to take shape. Any elements of redundancy present in the system that can be leveraged to mitigate risks are studied and enhanced in step 3. Step 4 continues the design of the error detection and error processing capabilities of the system. People will interact with the system being designed both as users and as operating personnel. Step 6 considers how the human computer interface can be made more robust and more error-free.

> 这种方法的好处是，它会让你思考系统可能出现的问题。容错心态从步骤 1 开始，在步骤 1 中识别故障和可能导致故障的风险因素。第 5 步回到风险和失败，看看是否在设计中添加了缓解技术来覆盖风险。第 2 步让您有机会思考风险、模式和其他有助于降低风险的技术。在此步骤中创建项目的模式语言。步骤 3 和 4 是容错设计开始形成的地方。在步骤 3 中，研究并增强了系统中存在的可用于降低风险的冗余元素。步骤 4 继续设计系统的错误检测和错误处理能力。人们将作为用户和操作人员与正在设计的系统交互。步骤 6 考虑了如何使人机界面更健壮、更无错误。
