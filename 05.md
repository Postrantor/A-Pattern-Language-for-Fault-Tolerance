# CHAPTER 5

# Detection Patterns

The first phase of fault tolerance is detection. Faults and the errors that they cause must be detected. Detection must occur before any recovery or mitigating actions can be taken to tolerate their presence in the system. Waiting and letting unknown latent faults activate and cause that result in failures is not fault tolerant.

> 容错的第一阶段是检测。必须检测故障及其导致的错误。在采取任何恢复或缓解措施以容忍其在系统中的存在之前，必须进行检测。等待并让未知潜在故障激活并导致故障是不容错的。

The patterns in this chapter help detect the presence of errors or failures and the faults that caused them. They provide a number of mechanisms to monitor the system and to detect if it is behaving erroneously. Two pairs of concepts drive detection at execution time. These are errors versus failures and _a priori_ knowledge versus comparison of redundant elements, see <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.27" id="c05.htm#fig5.27a">Figure 27</a>.

> 本章中的模式有助于检测错误或故障的存在以及导致它们的故障。它们提供了许多机制来监控系统并检测它是否有错误行为。两对概念在执行时驱动检测。这些是错误与故障，以及先验知识与冗余元素的比较，见图 27</a>。

_A priori_ detection uses constraints that are known in advance about the system to determine if some deviation from the normal situation of correctness exists. The range of results to be considered includes system states, results, and any side effects. If nothing is known about the range of results this method will obviously not work.

> \_先验检测使用预先已知的关于系统的约束来确定是否存在与正常正确情况的偏差。要考虑的结果范围包括系统状态、结果和任何副作用。如果对结果范围一无所知，那么这种方法显然行不通。

Much of the fault tolerant programming literature has focused on the second method, that of comparing redundant results. REDUNDANCY (3) in Chapter 4 discussed introducing redundant elements into the system. Many purpose-built systems with custom hardware use redundant hardware to execute the same program and the results. The comparison might be done in real time by hardware matchers that look at internal, partial computation results, or the comparison might be done at a system level with the complete computational results.

> 许多容错编程文献都集中于第二种方法，即比较冗余结果。第 4 章中的冗余（3）讨论了在系统中引入冗余元素。许多具有定制硬件的专用系统使用冗余硬件来执行相同的程序和结果。比较可以由硬件匹配器实时完成，硬件匹配器查看内部、部分计算结果，或者可以在系统级别与完整计算结果进行比较。

When comparisons are done there must be enough information present, either in the values to be compared or the context to enable the identification of the faulty component. Just determining that one is incorrect is helpful, but insufficient to fix the fault and prevent a failure from occurring.

> 进行比较时，必须在要比较的值或上下文中提供足够的信息，以便识别故障部件。仅确定一个错误是有帮助的，但不足以修复故障并防止故障发生。

Another aspect of detection is added by techniques that help a system to learn about correct system behavior. The system can keep a record of errors and faults that are detected and apply Bayesian learning techniques to learn to automatically detect errors and failures.

> 检测的另一个方面是通过帮助系统了解正确系统行为的技术而增加的。系统可以保存检测到的错误和故障的记录，并应用贝叶斯学习技术来学习自动检测错误和故障。

The system must be able to detect both errors and failures. It is more desirable to detect an error than to detect a failure. This is because errors have not yet become visible to the observers of the system as a deviation from the specification.

> 系统必须能够检测错误和故障。检测错误比检测故障更可取。这是因为对于系统的观察者来说，错误还没有成为与规范的偏差。

The most desirable means of failure handling in a computing system is when the error is detected automatically and corrected before it becomes a failure. If this is not possible, and a failure occurs, then the next most favorable options are the ‘fail-silent’ and then the crash failure mode, described in Chapter 1. When failing silently the erroneous element immediately stops processing without corrupting any of its peers. To ensure peers do not corrupt other peers through the error propagating, the failing element stops without informing them that it is stopping. The problem of detecting that an element has stopped functioning is a totally different and easier problem than the problem of determining if an element has stopped operating correctly.

> 计算系统中最理想的故障处理方法是自动检测错误并在其变为故障之前进行纠正。如果这是不可能的，并且发生了故障，那么接下来最有利的选择是“故障静音”，然后是第 1 章所述的碰撞故障模式。当无提示失败时，错误元素立即停止处理，而不会损坏其任何对等体。为了确保对等体不会通过错误传播破坏其他对等体，失败的元素会停止，而不会通知它们它正在停止。检测元件已停止工作的问题与确定元件是否已停止正常工作的问题是完全不同且更容易的问题。

Two mechanisms for detecting errors are in common use. The first is to test function return codes to determine if the function has returned reporting an error condition. The second is to use the exception or <span class="inlinecode">try/catch</span> capabilities built into many languages, such as C++, Java, and Ada. These mechanisms are used to detect that error conditions exist. They supplement the capabilities discussed by the patterns in this chapter.

> 常用两种检测错误的机制。第一个是测试函数返回代码，以确定函数是否返回报告错误条件。第二种是使用内置于多种语言（如 C++、Java 和 Ada）中的异常或<span class=“inlinecode”>try/catch</span>功能。这些机制用于检测是否存在错误条件。它们补充了本章中模式所讨论的功能。

The patterns in this chapter address detection from both the _a priori_ and redundant scenarios. Practical fault tolerant systems must begin error processing as soon as errors are detected, and so patterns related to the initial stages of error processing are also included in this chapter.

> 本章中的模式解决了从\_a 优先级和冗余场景进行检测的问题。实际的容错系统必须在检测到错误后立即开始错误处理，因此本章还包括与错误处理初始阶段相关的模式。

<a href="#c05.htm#tab5.1" id="c05.htm#tab5.1a">Table 5.1</a> lists all of the patterns in this chapter. Their order is that of the language shown in <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.28" id="c05.htm#fig5.28a">Figure 28</a> and also the order that the patterns appear within this chapter.

[Figure 28](#c05.htm#fig5.28) contains one possible language mapping for the patterns found in this chapter.

> [图 28]（#c05.htm#fig5.28）包含本章中找到的模式的一种可能的语言映射。

The patterns in this chapter aid the detection of errors and failures. When errors are detected they must be isolated and kept from spreading. The capability to isolate errors to specific units is possible once the UNITS OF MITIGATION (1) have been defined. FAULT CORRELATION (12) pinpoints and identifies the location of the fault by grouping and associating errors. ERROR CONTAINMENT BARRIER (13) discusses the detection and containment of errors. COMPLETE PARAMETER CHECKING (14) describes the most thorough way of preventing errors from passing through the boundaries between entities in the software design. This pattern advocates completely checking every value exchanged by the system, both internally and externally. If any are found to be outside the expected boundaries, or outside the boundaries of what is known in advance about the system, then an error is inferred.

> 本章中的模式有助于检测错误和故障。当检测到错误时，必须将其隔离并防止其扩散。一旦定义了缓解单元（1），就可以将错误隔离到特定单元。故障相关性（12）通过分组和关联错误来精确定位和识别故障的位置。错误遏制屏障（13）讨论了错误的检测和遏制。完整参数检查（14）描述了防止错误通过软件设计中实体之间边界的最彻底的方法。这种模式主张彻底检查系统内部和外部交换的每一个价值。如果发现任何超出预期边界，或超出系统预先已知的边界，则推断出错误。

The next collection of patterns is used to detect whether elements of execution (processes, tasks, threads, processors) have stopped working, Watchdogs have been used for many years in microcontroller-based systems. These systems have a processing element that acts strictly as the Watchdog element. This Watchdog will initiate a system reset to restart the microcontroller if it detects an anomaly. In systems built of parts larger than microcontrollers, Watchdog elements are enhanced by software components that oversee the monitoring. The Watchdog becomes one of the tools at the disposal of the monitor. The basic principle of a Watchdog, which is to have one element monitor the behavior of another, is found in several of the patterns in this chapter. SYSTEM MONITOR (15) talks about adding a task to the system that is in charge of monitoring whether the other parts are working. HEARTBEATS (16) is a key mechanism employed for this purpose. Information that a task is functioning normally can be sent as part of the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (17) of routine communications. In some cases the best way to check that tasks are functioning is to implement a WATCHDOG (18), which is a monitor that watches to see that a task is alive by the kind of interaction that it has with its peers.

> 下一组模式用于检测执行元素（进程、任务、线程、处理器）是否已停止工作。看门狗已在基于微控制器的系统中使用多年。这些系统有一个严格用作看门狗元素的处理元素。如果检测到异常，该看门狗将启动系统重置以重新启动微控制器。在由比微控制器更大的部件构建的系统中，看门狗元件由监控监控的软件组件增强。看门狗成为监视器可以使用的工具之一。看门狗的基本原理是让一个元素监视另一个元素的行为，这在本章的几个模式中可以找到。SYSTEM MONITOR（15）讨论向系统添加一个任务，该任务负责监视其他部件是否工作。心跳（16）是用于此目的的关键机制。任务正常运行的信息可以作为例行通信确认（17）的一部分发送。在某些情况下，检查任务是否正常工作的最佳方法是实现 WATCHDOG（18），这是一个监视器，它通过与对等方的交互来监视任务是否处于活动状态。

Many detection techniques rely on some sort of threshold to detect an error. It is important to set a REALISTIC THRESHOLD (19) to avoid falsely reporting errors.

> 许多检测技术依赖于某种阈值来检测错误。设置真实阈值（19）以避免错误报告非常重要。

Impending failures of the system’s performance must also be detected. Many different metrics are available within systems that are usable to detect this. EXISTING METRICS (20) discusses not adding new metrics but instead using ones that already exist.

> 还必须检测系统性能即将出现的故障。系统中有许多不同的指标可用于检测这一点。现有度量（20）讨论的不是添加新的度量，而是使用已经存在的度量。

When the system has REDUNDANT (3) elements, sometimes it is necessary to perform VOTING (21) to determine which is producing the correct result.

> 当系统具有冗余（3）元素时，有时需要执行投票（21）以确定哪个产生正确的结果。

Fault tolerant systems are made more reliable through ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (22) functions. By periodically identifying errors and correcting faults the system’s fault tolerance will be increased. When there are REDUNDANT (3) elements the technique of ROUTINE EXERCISES (23) to alternate which of the redundant elements is active and which is standby is very effective.

> 通过常规维护（22）功能，容错系统更可靠。通过定期识别错误和纠正故障，系统的容错能力将得到提高。当存在冗余（3）元件时，交替冗余元件中的哪一个是活动元件和哪一个备用元件的常规练习（23）技术非常有效。

To ensure that data that is used by the system is correct, ROUTINE AUDITS (24) are performed. The audits will correct any data that they find erroneous. CHECKSUMS (25) are a useful technique to detect data errors.

> 为确保系统使用的数据正确，执行例行审计（24）。审计将纠正他们发现的任何错误数据。CHECKSUMS（25）是检测数据错误的有用技术。

Two of the patterns, RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS (26) and LEAKY BUCKET COUNTER (27) discuss creating a threshold for an allowable number of errors. If the errors are permanent the threshold will be very low, probably one. If the errors are transients then a larger number may be tolerated before the system decides that recovery actions are needed.

> 其中两种模式，“越过瞬变”（26）和“泄漏铲斗计数器”（27）讨论了为允许的错误数量创建阈值。如果错误是永久性的，那么阈值将非常低，可能是一个。如果错误是瞬变的，那么在系统决定需要恢复操作之前，可以容忍更多的错误。

# 12. Fault Correlation

![](./OEBPS/images/88-1.jpg)

… An error or a failure has been detected. There are a number of potential causes for it.

> …检测到错误或故障。这有许多潜在的原因。

In order to be more fault tolerant the system has been designed to fail silently when it fails. As a result, all that is known when the failure is first detected is that it has failed. In order to process an error or failure the system needs to identify the error, and what fault caused the error.

> 为了提高容错性，系统设计为在发生故障时自动失效。因此，当第一次检测到故障时，所有已知的信息都是故障。为了处理错误或故障，系统需要识别错误以及导致错误的故障。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**What fault is activating?**

> **激活了什么故障**

Errors can be caused by any of several faults. Particular errors keep occurring. The system has been RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS (26) but the system needs to make certain that the current error is the one that it is interested in ignoring. If it is a different error then the system should initiate error processing.

> 错误可能由几种故障中的任何一种引起。特定错误不断发生。系统一直在超越瞬态（26），但系统需要确保当前错误是它感兴趣忽略的错误。如果是不同的错误，则系统应启动错误处理。

What has the error done? Has execution stopped? If so, what capabilities are no longer available? What was the size of the stack at the time of the error? Were logs collected? What data is incorrect? Is it frequently changing data or is it a constant?

> 错误发生了什么？执行停止了吗？如果是，哪些功能不再可用？发生错误时堆栈的大小是多少？是否收集了日志？哪些数据不正确？它是频繁变化的数据还是常量？

The system should correct the actual fault that has caused the problem. Too large a recovery will impact too much of the system. Identification of the fault allows targeted recovery actions to be taken. \[CBF+04\]

> 系统应排除导致故障的实际故障。太大的恢复会对系统造成太大的影响。故障识别允许采取有针对性的恢复措施\[CBF+04\]

Fault tolerance is about handling the unanticipated and undetectable errors that occur during execution. But as faults are being removed from the system during design and test, different common errors will have been uncovered, isolated, and corrected. The clues to error types, or their ‘signatures’, learned during these activities help you know what kinds of errors are likely to occur during normal execution.

> 容错是指处理执行过程中发生的意外和无法检测的错误。但是，随着在设计和测试期间从系统中排除故障，不同的常见错误将被发现、隔离和纠正。在这些活动中学习到的错误类型或其“特征”的线索有助于您了解在正常执行过程中可能发生的错误类型。

For example, if a large and complex system has a large number of off-by-one errors uncovered during test, the error signature found is that loops are traversed one too many times. This identifies a flaw in the execution limits of ranges or conditional checks. Since a large number of different occurrences were found during testing, there is a high probability that not all of them were uncovered during test and that some will be present in the production system. The system should be prepared through the addition of detection mechanisms that will find this kind of error. And the system should be programmed to correctly process off-by-one errors when they occur. In order to do this the system must be able to detect the errors, and determine that they are of the type ‘off-by-one’.

> 例如，如果一个大型复杂系统在测试过程中发现了大量逐个错误，则发现的错误特征是循环被遍历了太多次。这表明范围或条件检查的执行限制存在缺陷。由于在测试期间发现了大量不同的事件，因此很有可能在测试期间并没有发现所有这些事件，有些事件将出现在生产系统中。系统应通过添加检测机制来准备，以发现此类错误。系统应编程为在发生错误时正确处理一个错误。为了做到这一点，系统必须能够检测到错误，并确定它们属于“关闭一”类型。

The error must be masked so that the fault is tolerated. Identifying precisely what fault created the error is needed for treatment, but not for error processing. Similar errors can be given similar error processing treatment.

> 必须屏蔽错误，以允许故障。准确地识别产生错误的故障是需要进行处理的，而不是错误处理的。可以对类似的错误进行类似的错误处理。

For example, normal execution should resume after a failure in a REDUNDANT (3) unit. After the error is detected and identified to be a failing component, the fastest method of recovery is to FAILOVER (36) to the redundant unit. Treating the fault that produced the failure can be deferred until after application execution has been resumed on the standby unit.

> 例如，冗余（3）单元发生故障后，应恢复正常执行。在检测到错误并将其识别为故障部件后，最快的恢复方法是故障转移（36）到冗余单元。处理导致故障的故障可以推迟到在备用单元上恢复应用程序执行之后。

Errors can occur in clumps. One fault triggers an error that in turn triggers other errors. Failure can be prevented ideally by processing the initial fault that started the chain of errors. Some errors will come in groups by their nature affecting multiple instances of a resource close together. Again it is better to process the error through a correcting, recovery technique rather than mitigating each of the many instances.

> 错误可能以块状出现。一个故障触发一个错误，而该错误又触发其他错误。理想情况下，可以通过处理启动错误链的初始故障来防止故障。一些错误将按其性质分组出现，影响资源的多个实例。同样，通过纠正和恢复技术处理错误比减轻许多情况中的每一个要好。

When several errors occur close together in time, they might be related. In deciding what faults the system has, the multiple errors should be used to triangulate the location of the error.

> 当几个错误同时发生时，它们可能是相关的。在确定系统有哪些故障时，应使用多个错误来三角测量错误的位置。

When data errors are detected the correlation involves the identification of related data that also needs to be checked. The CORRECTING AUDITS (2) can assist with the association through Audit Implicator Indices that link related structures together as well as correct the data.

> 当检测到数据错误时，相关性涉及识别也需要检查的相关数据。纠正审计（2）可以通过将相关结构链接在一起并纠正数据的审计隐含指数来帮助关联。

Consider two examples: is missing a HEARTBEAT (16) message the result of a failed monitored task or is it because the communications link did not correctly convey the message? For an internet example, is the failure of the web page request due to a network failure or a failure of the web server? Whenever errors are suspected in peers that are at the other end of a communications link from the detection point, communications failures must be added to the list of potential errors.

> 考虑两个示例：丢失 HEARTBEAT（16）消息是监控任务失败的结果，还是因为通信链路未正确传递消息？对于互联网示例，网页请求的失败是由于网络故障还是 web 服务器故障？无论何时，在检测点通信链路另一端的对等体中怀疑存在错误，都必须将通信故障添加到潜在错误列表中。

The system can be designed to grow its ability to detect and process errors through Bayesian learning techniques. The system can maintain information about the errors that are detected and the successful processing steps and learn how to recognize and process errors that were not covered in the initial design.

> 该系统可以设计为通过贝叶斯学习技术提高其检测和处理错误的能力。系统可以维护关于检测到的错误和成功处理步骤的信息，并学习如何识别和处理初始设计中未涵盖的错误。

Therefore,

> 因此

**Look at the unique signature of the error to sort it into the fault category for which error processing steps are known, <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.29" id="c05.htm#fig5.29a">Figure 29</a>.**

Once an error has been characterized by its signature an ERROR CONTAINMENT BARRIER (13) can be established to prevent it from spreading.

> 一旦错误通过其签名表征，则可以建立错误包含屏障（13）以防止其扩散。

The system will know the most effective means to handle the error because it has been grouped into a set for which the best actions are known. The patterns in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 describe techniques for error processing, ranging from MARKED DATA (56) for data errors to altering execution sequence through ROLLBACK (32) and RESTART (31). When the correlation identifies the error as being related to overload, OVERLOAD TOOLBOXES (42) will help the system determine the correct actions to take.

> 系统将知道处理错误的最有效方法，因为它已被分组到已知最佳操作的集合中。第 6 章和第 7 章中的模式描述了错误处理技术，从数据错误的标记数据（56）到通过 ROLLBACK（32）和 RESTART（31）更改执行顺序。当相关性将错误识别为与过载相关时，过载工具箱（42）将帮助系统确定要采取的正确操作。

The correlations and supporting data should be shared via the FAULT OBSERVER (10). This allows people, through MAXIMIZE HUMAN PARTICIPATION (6), to take preventive actions or to schedule ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (22) to correct the fault. …

# 13. Error Containment Barrier

![](./OEBPS/images/91-1.jpg)

… The system is designed to perform as well as it can in the presence of faults. The necessary fault tolerance framework elements are in place. The software knows that it is supposed to be within a highly available system. The mechanisms for detection of faults have been designed into the system. The system is designed as a collection of UNITS OF MITIGATION (1).

> …该系统设计为在出现故障时尽可能良好地运行。必要的容错框架元素已到位。该软件知道它应该在一个高度可用的系统中。系统中设计了故障检测机制。该系统设计为缓解单元（1）的集合。

Errors in one part of the system, or in one computation, can spread and cause errors or failures at other places in the system. Errors spread through several mechanisms: erroneous messages, corrupted (incorrect) pooled memory or actions based on the results of other incorrect actions.

> 系统的一部分或一次计算中的错误可能会扩散，并在系统的其他地方导致错误或故障。错误通过几种机制传播：错误消息、损坏（错误）的池内存或基于其他错误操作结果的操作。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**What is the first thing that the system must do when it detects an error?**

> **当系统检测到错误时，首先必须做什么**

Unless something is done the error will continue through the system forever or until it eventually causes a failure that results in termination. This is the nature of errors.

> 除非采取某种措施，否则错误将在系统中永远持续，或直到最终导致导致终止的故障。这就是错误的本质。

The effects of an error cannot always be predicted in advance. Nor can all the potential errors be predicted. Software reliability modeling, verification techniques, fault prevention techniques, and software quality efforts reduce the number of faults present in the system. The system must be adaptable and able to handle unanticipated errors. This capability must be put in place during the design phase. The capabilities require conscious preparation. This is the Fault Tolerant Mindset.

> 错误的影响不能总是预先预测。也不能预测所有潜在的错误。软件可靠性建模、验证技术、故障预防技术和软件质量努力减少了系统中存在的故障数量。系统必须具有适应性，能够处理意外错误。该能力必须在设计阶段落实到位。这些能力需要有意识的准备。这就是容错心态。

Fault tolerance is living with faults. The system must find a way to ignore or mask the faults in order to tolerate them. But some ways of masking errors result in their still being propagated throughout the system. If the system does not just ‘ignore’ errors, what can it do? One option is to cry ‘HELP’ and terminate. But this does not fit into the framework of fault tolerance within the system (see MINIMIZE HUMAN INTERVENTION (5)). Sometimes terminating is the only practical option, for example when an error is detected that makes the system unsafe.

> 容错就是与错误共存。系统必须找到一种方法来忽略或掩盖故障，以容忍它们。但是一些掩盖错误的方法导致错误仍然在整个系统中传播。如果系统不只是“忽略”错误，它能做什么？一种选择是喊“HELP”并终止。但这不符合系统内的容错框架（参见最小化人为干预（5））。有时，终止是唯一可行的选择，例如，当检测到导致系统不安全的错误时。

Another option is to take steps to mitigate the error. This is not always possible though; it depends on the nature of the error and the fault. Some errors, particularly data errors, can be mitigated by means such as CORRECTING AUDITS (2).

> 另一种选择是采取措施减轻错误。但这并不总是可能的；这取决于错误和故障的性质。一些错误，特别是数据错误，可以通过纠正审计（2）等方法减轻。

An effective way of mitigation for some errors is to mark them for all other parts of the system to know that they are erroneous. This eliminates the need for the other parts of the system to detect the errors; they can concentrate on taking the steps appropriate for them to mitigate them. This is discussed in MARKED DATA (56).

> 减轻某些错误的一种有效方法是标记它们，以便系统的所有其他部分知道它们是错误的。这消除了系统的其他部分检测错误的需要；他们可以集中精力采取适合自己的措施来缓解这些问题。标记数据（56）中对此进行了讨论。

Sometimes the errors cannot be corrected automatically, but since you chose to MINIMIZE HUMAN INTERVENTION (5) the system will try automatic recovery. In these cases error recovery steps must be taken to move the system to an error free state.

> 有时错误无法自动纠正，但由于您选择了最小化人为干预（5），系统将尝试自动恢复。在这些情况下，必须采取错误恢复步骤，将系统移至无错误状态。

Errors move, or propagate, from component to component in the system unless something is done to stop them. In software the barrier is the boundary of the UNIT OF MITIGATION (1) that contains the fail-silent component. Failing silently implies that any error that is detected within a UNIT OF MITIGATION presents a silent interface to other parts of the system. The actual internal errors are masked to provide only an indication of silent failure. When this is detected the signs and symptoms of the detected error are sent to FAULT CORRELATION (12) which analyzes the error providing guidance to the techniques most useful to process the error.

> 错误在系统中的组件之间移动或传播，除非采取措施阻止它们。在软件中，屏障是包含故障静音组件的缓解单元（1）的边界。无声失败意味着在缓解单元内检测到的任何错误都会向系统的其他部分提供无声接口。实际内部错误被屏蔽，仅提供无声故障的指示。当检测到这一点时，检测到的错误的符号和症状被发送到故障关联（12），故障关联分析错误，为处理错误提供最有用的技术指导。

Therefore,

> 因此

**The system should isolate the error to a UNIT OF MITIGATION (1).

In order to be able to contain errors the system must be able to detect them. Additionally it must have the ability to decide what course of action is the safest given the circumstances of the error. Detection as close to the fault in either structural proximity or time is the best case scenario.

The error should be isolated and contained by techniques discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 that recover from an error or mitigate the effects of the error. COMPLETE PARAMETER CHECKING (14) provides a means to detect that an error has not been contained.

> 应通过第 6 章和第 7 章中讨论的从错误中恢复或减轻错误影响的技术来隔离和控制错误。完整参数检查（14）提供了一种检测未包含错误的方法。

Faulty hardware components can be isolated by activity bits that indicate whether a particular component is in service, or in error processing, or in some other state. When isolating faulty hardware it is very important to prevent the faulty component from spreading malicious information across the system, the so-called babbling problem. A way to address this is to isolate network connections (or other communication links) to the faulty component. MARKED DATA (56) describes a method of marking erroneous information to contain its future use. ERROR CORRECTING CODES (57) and CORRECTING AUDITS (2) discuss ways of correcting erroneous information. The collection of patterns that includes ROLLBACK (32), ROLL-FORWARD (33) as well as RETURN TO REFERENCE POINT (34) and RESTART (31) discuss ways of transitioning to an error free state.

> 有故障的硬件组件可以通过活动位来隔离，这些活动位指示特定组件是在使用中，还是在错误处理中，或者处于其他状态。在隔离故障硬件时，防止故障组件在整个系统中传播恶意信息非常重要，这就是所谓的胡言乱语问题。解决这一问题的一种方法是隔离故障部件的网络连接（或其他通信链路）。标记数据（56）描述了一种标记错误信息以包含其未来用途的方法。纠错码（57）和纠错审计（2）讨论了纠正错误信息的方法。包括 ROLLBACK（32）、ROLL-FORWARD（33）以及 RETURN TO REFERENCE POINT（34）和 RESTART（31）的模式集合讨论了转换到无错误状态的方法。

# 14. Complete Parameter Checking

![](./OEBPS/images/94-1.jpg)

… You want to detect errors before they cause a problem. Faults and errors result in the system being unavailable. They also cause the system’s functions to be erroneous, making the system undependable.

> …您希望在错误导致问题之前检测错误。故障和错误导致系统不可用。它们还会导致系统功能错误，使系统不可靠。

Errors in one part of the system propagate to other parts of the system. If the errors are incorrect computational results, then errors can compound as they move through the system. If the errors are incorrect actions, they can trigger further erroneous actions.

> 系统的一部分中的错误会传播到系统的其他部分。如果错误是不正确的计算结果，那么错误可能会随着它们在系统中的移动而加剧。如果错误是不正确的操作，则可能会触发进一步的错误操作。

The system’s requirements are exacting. The dependability of the system is important. Not only must the system be available, it must also be correct. The system is performing an application that has a high cost associated with failure, for example the system is safety-critical. Another example is in critical functions of the system that are instrumental to all other functions completing correctly, such as a task scheduler in a real-time system. In this last context the individual tasks that are scheduled can fail without adverse system consequences, but all of the tasks must be given an opportunity to execute which requires the scheduler to be operational.

> 该系统的要求非常严格。系统的可靠性很重要。系统不仅必须可用，而且必须正确。该系统正在执行与故障相关的高成本的应用，例如该系统是安全关键的。另一个例子是系统的关键功能，这些功能有助于正确完成所有其他功能，例如实时系统中的任务调度器。在最后一种情况下，被调度的单个任务可能会失败，而不会产生不利的系统后果，但必须给所有任务一个执行的机会，这需要调度程序能够运行。

The other patterns in this book are ensuring that the dependable components are executing through the use of a SYSTEM MONITOR (15), possibly with HEARTBEATS (16) or a WATCHDOG (18) function. CORRECTING AUDITS (2) and CHECKSUMS (25) are used to ensure that data stored in memory is correct.

> 本书中的其他模式是通过使用系统监视器（15）（可能带有心跳（16）或看门狗（18）功能）来确保可靠组件的执行。纠正审计（2）和校验和（25）用于确保存储在内存中的数据是正确的。

It takes time to detect an error. The further from the point of error, when a fault activates, that detection occurs, the larger window in which it could fail, or could propagate to other parts of the system.

> 检测错误需要时间。距离错误点越远，当故障激活时，检测发生，检测可能失败或传播到系统的其他部分的窗口越大。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**How can the time from fault activation to error detection be minimized?**

> **如何将从故障激活到错误检测的时间最小化**

The fastest option is to check for error at every operation that the system conducts. An example is an active-active REDUNDANT (3) pair of processors that are operating in lock-step and comparing results on every basic operation, and reporting an error when there is a mismatch. This is how the central processors in the 4ESS™ Switch interact. This tight coupling and rapid detection works best for hardware failures, and not as well for software failures because the two processors are executing the same program and will both compute an erroneous result from the same incorrect input; and since the results matched in each processor the error will not be detected.

> 最快的选择是在系统执行的每个操作中检查错误。一个例子是一对主动-主动冗余（3）处理器，它们以锁定步骤运行，并比较每个基本操作的结果，当出现不匹配时报告错误。这就是 4ESS 中的中央处理器 ™ 开关交互。这种紧密耦合和快速检测最适合硬件故障，而不适合软件故障，因为两个处理器正在执行相同的程序，并且都将从相同的错误输入计算错误结果；并且由于结果在每个处理器中匹配，所以不会检测到错误。

Other systems, such as the Space Shuttle computers, compute results simultaneously but only compare their end results \[Skl76\], frequently by VOTING (21). This relaxation of timing allows different, REDUNDANT (3) software implementations to be used to compute the results. Detection is still fast, but it is slower than lock step.

> 其他系统，如航天飞机计算机，同时计算结果，但只比较最终结果，通常通过投票（21）。这种时间的放松允许使用不同的冗余（3）软件实现来计算结果。检测仍然很快，但比锁定步骤慢。

Both of these examples, the 4ESS™ Switch and the Space Shuttle, rely both on REDUNDANCY (3) and the frequent checks and comparisons of low-level results. When REDUNDANCY is not present in the system the comparisons can still occur.

> 这两个例子，4ESS™ Switch 和航天飞机，既依赖冗余（3），也依赖对低水平结果的频繁检查和比较。当系统中不存在冗余时，仍可进行比较。

There can be many things that can be checked even without redundant results to compare. You know at design time the acceptable ranges of values for function/method arguments and also for basic computations. The system can use these attributes to detect errors. An example is to check whether the index to an entry being removed from a buffer is within the acceptable range of buffer indices.

> 即使没有多余的结果进行比较，也可以检查许多内容。在设计时，您知道函数/方法参数以及基本计算的可接受值范围。系统可以使用这些属性来检测错误。一个示例是检查从缓冲区中删除的条目的索引是否在缓冲区索引的可接受范围内。

Any checking that is done results in increased reliability. Arguments passed into a function or method, the results returned from functions and methods, and the results of computations can all be checked.

> 所做的任何检查都会提高可靠性。传递到函数或方法中的参数、从函数和方法返回的结果以及计算结果都可以检查。

The time between fault activation and their detection decreases with the frequency of checks, as the checks get closer together temporally and spatially. The trade off is that it reduces performance, since all the extra checks take time. Determining the correct checks to add takes development time that could be spent on other things, and these add to the maintenance requirements of the system.

> 故障激活和检测之间的时间随着检查的频率而减少，因为检查在时间和空间上越来越接近。权衡的结果是，它会降低性能，因为所有额外的检查都需要时间。确定要添加的正确检查需要花费开发时间，这可能会花费在其他事情上，并且会增加系统的维护需求。

The checks can be put inline with the actual processing that uses the data being checked, but that can lead to confusion. In many cases the checks can be reused among a number of operations (in this example, for the other arithmetic computations). Putting the checks in a separate place, possibly a library, can make maintenance easier. Since it is the elementary operations that are being checked, a separate function or method for each elementary operation can be used to perform all the necessary checks.

> 检查可以与使用被检查数据的实际处理内联，但这可能会导致混淆。在许多情况下，检查可以在多个操作中重复使用（在本例中，用于其他算术计算）。将支票放在一个单独的地方，可能是一个图书馆，可以使维护更容易。由于检查的是基本操作，因此可以使用每个基本操作的单独函数或方法来执行所有必要的检查。

Basic operations of the system, even as simple as division, can be checked to ensure that it was performed correctly. Consider:

> 可以检查系统的基本操作，甚至简单到划分，以确保正确执行。考虑：

![equation](./OEBPS/images/95-1.gif)

Partial input validation would check that B and C are within the general ranges that are appropriate for the operation. That A is a valid receiver of the information is also checked. Strict typing, either by coding standard or by language support, can help to make sure that operations are on appropriate types of data.

> 部分输入验证将检查 B 和 C 是否在适用于操作的一般范围内。还检查 A 是否是信息的有效接收者。通过编码标准或语言支持，严格的类型可以帮助确保对适当类型的数据进行操作。

To completely check the input in this case will require this additional check be made so that overflow and underflow won’t result. (The IEEE Not A Number standard is discussed in MARKED DATA (56). This is not meant as a pattern language linkage between these patterns.) In this example, the absolute value of C is checked to ensure correct operation by both the common two’s compliment and the more rare one’s compliment processors.

> 为了在这种情况下完全检查输入，需要进行额外的检查，以便不会导致溢出和下溢。（IEEE 非数字标准在标记数据（56）中讨论。这并不意味着这些模式之间的模式语言联系。）在本例中，检查 C 的绝对值，以确保常见的两个补码处理器和较罕见的补码处理器的正确操作。

![equation](./OEBPS/images/96-1.gif)

Base the decision to include a check on these considerations: What is the probability of error within the entity that is checked? How critical are any errors that occur within that entity? If errors are likely or errors are critical perform a check.

> 基于以下考虑因素做出包括检查的决定：被检查实体内出错的概率是多少？该实体内发生的任何错误有多严重？如果可能出现错误或错误非常严重，请执行检查。

Some computations that a system performs are very expensive. When a less costly approximation is available, it can be used to check that the result of the expensive computation is reasonable.

> 系统执行的一些计算非常昂贵。当成本较低的近似值可用时，可以使用它来检查昂贵计算的结果是否合理。

Every method or function has assumptions about results of the operations it invokes. A check to validate that the assumptions are correct detects errors before they can spread.

> 每个方法或函数都对其调用的操作的结果有假设。验证假设是否正确的检查会在错误扩散之前检测到错误。

Programming by contract is a variation of the checking everything proposed by this pattern. A method or function has a ‘contract’ that specifies its interface and the obligations and benefits to both caller and called methods or functions. The obligations specify the preconditions that the caller must guarantee when making the call. This benefits the called function or method by ensuring that it receives correct, or at least not erroneous, inputs. The called function or method then guarantees that it will provide a result to its caller that is not erroneous. These contracts are implemented by using checks before and after the processing to ensure that both the input and the output of the method/function meet the contracted specification.

> 契约式编程是检查此模式提出的所有内容的变体。方法或函数有一个“契约”，它指定了它的接口以及调用方和被调用方法或函数的义务和好处。这些义务规定了呼叫者在拨打电话时必须保证的先决条件。这有利于被调用的函数或方法，确保它接收到正确的输入，或者至少没有错误的输入。然后，被调用的函数或方法保证它将向调用者提供一个没有错误的结果。这些契约通过在处理前后进行检查来实现，以确保方法/函数的输入和输出都符合契约规范。

Therefore,

> 违反任何基本操作都表示错误，应开始错误处理。

When data errors are detected the error should be reported to CORRECTING AUDITS (2) which will perform FAULT CORRELATION(12) to find, check, and correct related data. Many systems, such as the 5ESS® Switch, report on the output channel any violations of the basic checks. In this and other systems, these are called asserts. Asserts are frequently used during testing, but are useful during normal execution in moderation. In keeping with MINIMIZE HUMAN INTERVENTION (5) important information should not be lost in a flood of asserts.

> 当检测到数据错误时，应向纠正审计（2）报告错误，纠正审计将执行故障相关（12），以查找、检查和纠正相关数据。许多系统（如 5ESS® 交换机）在输出通道上报告任何违反基本检查的情况。在这个和其他系统中，这些被称为断言。断言在测试期间经常使用，但在适度的正常执行期间很有用。为了尽量减少人为干预（5），重要信息不应在大量断言中丢失。

A variation to detecting errors as described here and passing them to the error processing mechanisms is to mask the detected error into an acceptable result. For all the results generated by the system an ‘acceptability envelope’ is constructed. Layers of components surrounding the core modules will mask any errors coming out of the core by changing the error into something that is within the acceptability envelope. This technique can be used as a wrapper around already existing code that needs to be made more fault tolerant, or it can be used with a less well written code to mask its faults. \[Rin03\]. …

> 这里描述的检测错误并将其传递给错误处理机制的一种变体是将检测到的错误屏蔽为可接受的结果。对于系统产生的所有结果，构建了“可接受范围”。核心模块周围的组件层将通过将错误更改为可接受范围内的内容来掩盖来自核心的任何错误。这种技术可以作为现有代码的包装器，这些代码需要更加容错，也可以与编写得不太好的代码一起使用，以掩盖其错误\[Rin03\]…

… The system that you are designing must be available continuously. The design of the system is for it to exhibit crash failures, where it silently stops working. When part of it stops working, the system needs to find out quickly so that recovery techniques can be applied. A FAULT OBSERVER (10) is in use to coordinate information flow.

> …您正在设计的系统必须持续可用。该系统的设计是为了显示碰撞故障，在那里它无声地停止工作。当它的一部分停止工作时，系统需要快速发现，以便应用恢复技术。故障观察器（10）用于协调信息流。

You know the characteristics of the interprocessor and intraprocessor communications systems, such as paths and performance characteristics. You can add additional messages without harming system behavior by saturating the system.

> 您知道处理器间和处理器内通信系统的特性，例如路径和性能特性。您可以通过使系统饱和来添加其他消息，而不会损害系统行为。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**How does one part of the system keep track that another part is alive and functioning?**

> **系统的一部分是如何跟踪另一部分是活动的和运行的**

The silent cessation of operations in a fail-silent mode or crash failure mode is the best for ensuring the system’s continued operation because it minimizes error propagation. However, when a part of the system just stops, silently, the other parts might not realize, and they might not take the steps needed to keep the overall application working correctly. There must be some way of finding out if a needed part of the system is still working.

> 在故障静音模式或崩溃故障模式下静默停止操作是确保系统持续运行的最佳方式，因为它将错误传播降至最低。然而，当系统的一部分只是默默地停止时，其他部分可能不会意识到，并且他们可能不会采取保持整个应用程序正常工作所需的步骤。必须有某种方法来确定系统中所需的部分是否仍在工作。

If the part of the system that has a failure can safely inform the rest of the system about its state then error recovery can begin more quickly. However, stopping silently is preferred to the situation where the failing component is aggressive about telling the world that it has a problem. Blindly reporting the problem to everyone uses up networking bandwidth and processing power, especially since not all of the other parts of the system need to know.

> 如果发生故障的系统部分可以安全地通知系统的其他部分其状态，那么错误恢复可以更快地开始。然而，在出现故障的组件咄咄逼人地告诉世界它有问题的情况下，最好是安静地停止。盲目地向每个人报告问题会消耗网络带宽和处理能力，特别是因为系统的其他部分不需要知道。

An alternative is that the failing component just keeps ‘looking’ like it is working: Performing actions but not performing them correctly. This is a significant problem because it can fool everyone into thinking that the failing component is working correctly. This is a malicious failure and is very hard to detect.

> 另一种选择是，失败的组件只是保持“看起来”正常工作：执行操作，但没有正确执行。这是一个重要的问题，因为它可以欺骗每个人，让他们认为故障组件工作正常。这是一个恶意故障，很难检测到。

You could rely on ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (17) messages. These are sent from one component to another in response to something happening. They work well when the system can’t afford any messaging bandwidth or processing time to proactively monitor them. A problem is that acknowledgements require that there be an ordinary exchange of information that can stimulate the acknowledgements. If this routine exchange does not exist then acknowledgements will not solve the problem.

> 您可以依赖确认（17）消息。响应于发生的事件，这些消息从一个组件发送到另一个组件。当系统无法提供任何消息带宽或处理时间来主动监控它们时，它们可以很好地工作。一个问题是，确认需要有一个可以激发确认的普通信息交换。如果此例程交换不存在，则确认不会解决问题。

Another solution is to create a mechanism that will actively monitor whether part of the system has stopped working. It could be in the same processor or in a different processor. Choosing a location for this monitor is highly sensitive to the context. If the system is a simple one that must execute on a single processor and hardware support is unavailable, it must be located as a separate task on the same processor. If the system is a custom development with the option of adding a separate monitor hardware component, and the system’s reliability requirements are stringent, then separate hardware is the correct choice.

> 另一个解决方案是创建一个机制，该机制将主动监控系统的一部分是否停止工作。它可以在同一个处理器中，也可以在不同的处理器中。为此监视器选择位置对上下文高度敏感。如果系统是一个必须在单个处理器上执行的简单系统，并且硬件支持不可用，则必须将其作为一个单独的任务放置在同一处理器上。如果系统是定制开发，可选择添加单独的监视器硬件组件，并且系统的可靠性要求严格，则单独的硬件是正确的选择。

The monitoring capability can be distributed throughout the system in the most efficient way. Their activities must be coordinated and their responsibilities clearly defined to avoid gaps in coverage.

> 监控能力可以以最有效的方式分布在整个系统中。必须协调他们的活动，明确界定他们的责任，以避免覆盖范围的差距。

An important part of the monitoring task’s purpose is to watch for failures in parts of the system and report a problem if they stop working. The monitor can monitor one component of the system, or it could monitor several important components, taking the correct actions when one of them stops. WATCHDOGS (18) are useful to implement this.

> 监控任务的一个重要部分是监视系统部分的故障，并在它们停止工作时报告问题。监视器可以监视系统的一个组件，也可以监视几个重要组件，在其中一个组件停止时采取正确的操作。看门狗（18）对实现这一点很有用。

Once you’ve decided to include a SYSTEM MONITOR you must decide how long it should wait before sounding an alarm. REALISTIC THRESHOLD (19) discusses appropriate threshold times. RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS (26) and LEAKY BUCKET COUNTERS (27) discuss ways of making sure that the anomalous behavior that the system is seeing is an actual problem rather than a transient or intermittent problem.

> 一旦您决定包含系统监视器，您必须决定在发出警报之前应等待多长时间。真实阈值（19）讨论了适当的阈值时间。跨越瞬态（26）和泄漏铲斗计数器（27）讨论了确保系统所看到的异常行为是实际问题而不是瞬态或间歇性问题的方法。

The SYSTEM MONITOR can operate in several ways. If additional resources (processing and messaging both) can be spared for the monitoring tasks, HEARTBEAT (16) messages received from the monitored tasks are useful. If software and communications resources cannot be spared, perhaps specialized hardware can be added to the task from afar, just keeping track that it is behaving correctly. This is a WATCHDOG (18).

> 系统监视器可以多种方式运行。如果可以为监控任务预留额外的资源（处理和消息），则从监控任务接收的 HEARTBEAT（16）消息是有用的。如果不能节省软件和通信资源，也许可以从远处将专用硬件添加到任务中，只需跟踪其运行是否正确。这是一只看门狗（18）。

Now that you’ve created a way to find out if a watched task is still functioning, what should the system do when it is not? At the most basic level, the SYSTEM MONITOR should inform the FAULT OBSERVER (10). Refer to patterns about recovery and mitigation presented in Chapters 6 and 7 for other suggestions of actions to take if the SYSTEM MONITOR detects an error. If there is a FAULT OBSERVER present in the system then the detected error, and the planned error processing, should be reported to it. In systems with extreme fault tolerance requirements the FAULT OBSERVER is frequently the entity that takes a global view of the situation and decides on the best processing steps to take, taking on the role of SOMEONE IN CHARGE (8).

> 现在，您已经创建了一种方法来确定被监视的任务是否仍在运行，当它不运行时，系统应该怎么做？在最基本的级别上，系统监视器应通知故障观察者（10）。如果系统监视器检测到错误，请参考第 6 章和第 7 章中提供的恢复和缓解模式，以获取其他建议。如果系统中存在故障观察者，则应向其报告检测到的错误和计划的错误处理。在具有极端容错要求的系统中，故障观察者通常是对情况进行全局观察并决定要采取的最佳处理步骤的实体，承担负责人的角色（8）。

The correct choice of action to recover the component depends on the system’s context and requirements. In a situation such as a financial application, where numeric correctness is required, shutting down the system so it no longer processes transactions is sometimes the desirable option. This is an example of CONCENTRATED RECOVERY (29). For example, it would be better for an Automatic Teller Machine to stop taking customer requests than to erroneously dispense money while it is processing an error. In a situation where high availability is required, but where correctness is not as important, there are three other error processing options that could be employed: Switching to a standby process/task via REDUNDANCY (3), restarting the faulty task with RESTART (31) or just noting the situation and leaving the remedy to a human through MAXIMIZE HUMAN PARTICIPATION (6). …

> 恢复组件的正确操作选择取决于系统的上下文和需求。在金融应用程序等需要数字正确性的情况下，关闭系统以使其不再处理交易有时是理想的选择。这是一个集中回收的例子（29）。例如，自动柜员机在处理错误时停止接受客户请求比错误地分配钱要好。在需要高可用性但正确性不那么重要的情况下，可以采用其他三种错误处理选项：通过冗余（3）切换到备用进程/任务，通过重启（31）重新启动故障任务，或者仅注意情况，通过最大限度的人参与（6）将补救措施留给人类…

**How does the SYSTEM MONITOR know that a particular monitored task is still working?**

> **系统监视器如何知道特定监控任务仍在工作**

If the SYSTEM MONITOR (15) does not have any indication that a task is still functioning (still alive) it will be assumed to have failed and error processing action should be taken as described in SYSTEM MONITOR. Unnecessary error processing wastes system resources.

> 如果系统监视器（15）没有任何任务仍在运行（仍在运行中）的指示，则认为该任务已失败，应按照系统监视器中的说明采取错误处理措施。不必要的错误处理会浪费系统资源。

If the activity level is low then the monitored task might look dead when it is only idle. The monitored task must do something to let the monitors know that it is working. This could be to change a flag value occasionally, send a message to the monitor reporting health, execute a special system call, etc.

> 如果活动级别较低，则受监视的任务在仅处于空闲状态时可能会看起来不起作用。被监视的任务必须做一些事情，让监视器知道它正在工作。这可能是偶尔更改标志值、向监控器发送消息报告运行状况、执行特殊系统调用等。

The health reports, or heartbeats, should occur at regular intervals. The timing enables the SYSTEM MONITOR (15) to detect that the monitored task has fallen behind or missed a report. REALISTIC THRESHOLD (19) provides guidance for setting appropriate intervals.

> 健康报告或心跳应该定期出现。定时使系统监视器（15）能够检测到所监视的任务落后或错过了报告。真实阈值（19）提供了设置适当间隔的指导。

Sometimes the task being monitored does not realize that it is being watched. This occurs when an existing application is being integrated into a highly available environment. When the existing application gains its new responsibilities, sometimes it cannot be altered, so it can’t assume a more active part of the monitoring relationship. The monitored task might have such an important place in the system that it does not care that others know it is alive; it assumes that it always will be. This kind of task frequently arises when people unfamiliar with fault tolerance principles design without considering the possibility of faults, errors and failures. In these cases the SYSTEM MONITOR (15) should initiate a request for a status report or ‘heartbeat’.

> 有时被监视的任务没有意识到它正在被监视。当将现有应用程序集成到高可用环境中时，就会出现这种情况。当现有应用程序获得新的职责时，有时它无法更改，因此它无法在监控关系中承担更积极的部分。被监视的任务可能在系统中具有如此重要的位置，以至于它不关心其他人是否知道它是活的；当人们不熟悉容错原则设计而不考虑故障、错误和故障的可能性时，这种任务经常出现。在这些情况下，系统监视器（15）应启动状态报告或“心跳”请求。

You must weigh the time overhead associated with adding messages or other fault tolerance related actions with the benefit of the coverage that they provide. During idle periods the overhead will be negligible. During busy periods the REALISTIC THRESHOLD (19) is very important to reduce the unnecessary overhead that is draining processing and messaging bandwidth from real work. When the system is busy heartbeat messages can lead to extra messages that aren’t necessary because the stream of ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (17) is giving sufficient status information. In these cases you can use the correct processing of a sequence of requests as a sign of life. See DEFERRABLE WORK (43) and WATCHDOG (18). Building the intelligence to vary the thresholds (REALISTIC THRESHOLD) based upon workload level adds complexity and introduces faults.

> 您必须权衡与添加消息或其他容错相关操作相关的时间开销以及它们提供的覆盖范围的好处。在空闲期间，开销可以忽略不计。在繁忙时期，真实阈值（19）对于减少从实际工作中消耗处理和消息带宽的不必要开销非常重要。当系统忙时，心跳消息可能会导致额外的消息，而这些消息是不必要的，因为确认流（17）正在提供足够的状态信息。在这些情况下，您可以将正确处理一系列请求作为生命的标志。参见可防御工程（43）和看门狗（18）。根据工作负载级别构建智能以改变阈值（真实阈值）会增加复杂性并引入故障。

The heartbeat from the monitored task to the monitor can be a message periodically if the monitored and monitoring tasks are separated by a message passing interface.

> 如果被监视任务和监视任务通过消息传递接口分离，则从被监视任务到监视器的心跳可以是周期性的消息。

A ‘ping like’ message is a very simple way for the SYSTEM MONITOR (15) to ask if the monitored task is still processing. The message will stimulate an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (17) response. However, too many of these messages, both in frequency between any pair, and related to the number of monitored tasks, can saturate the messaging system and should only be done when the system can add additional messages without harming system behavior.

> “类 ping”消息是系统监视器（15）询问被监视任务是否仍在处理的一种非常简单的方式。该消息将激发确认（17）响应。然而，这些消息太多，无论是在任何对之间的频率上，还是与被监视任务的数量有关，都会使消息传递系统饱和，只有当系统可以添加额外的消息而不损害系统行为时，才应该这样做。

Another way for the monitored task to report that it is still processing is for it to regularly execute a system call that was created for heartbeating purposes. Failure to execute the system call at a predetermined interval indicates a failure.

> 监视任务报告其仍在处理的另一种方法是定期执行为心跳目的创建的系统调用。未能以预定间隔执行系统调用表示失败。

Care must be taken that the heartbeats do not have unintended side effects. For example, switching to a part of the program to send a heartbeat interrupts normal processing and if done improperly the system state might not be restored correctly after the heartbeat is sent.

> 必须注意心跳不会产生意外的副作用。例如，切换到程序的一部分以发送心跳会中断正常处理，如果操作不当，则在发送心跳后系统状态可能无法正确恢复。

There are two variants to this solution: In the first one the monitored task sends a periodic, autonomous report to the SYSTEM MONITOR (15) to show that it is alive. In the second the SYSTEM MONITOR requests the monitored task give it a report. Choosing a variant depends on factors such as the complexity that will be built into the SYSTEM MONITOR, whether the monitored task can be enhanced with the automatic capability.

> 此解决方案有两种变体：在第一种方案中，被监视的任务向系统监视器（15）发送一个周期性的、自主的报告，以显示其处于活动状态。第二秒，系统监视器请求被监视的任务给它一个报告。选择一个变量取决于以下因素，例如系统监视器的复杂性，是否可以通过自动功能增强被监视的任务。

If the heartbeats arrive, but do not look quite right, the SYSTEM MONITOR (15) must decide if it was a fault in the communications system, or if the monitored system is alive – but not well. Heartbeats can also be enhanced to check correctness of functioning.

> 如果心跳到达，但看起来不太正确，则系统监视器（15）必须确定是通信系统故障，还是被监控系统处于活动状态——但不正常。心跳也可以增强以检查功能的正确性。

> 通信路径的故障将显示为受监控的系统没有运行，因为它没有响应 HEARTBEAT 消息。需要故障关联（12）以确保检测到通信故障。

The amount of time that a heartbeat message takes to go from monitored task to monitoring task, or round trip from the monitor, is also an indication of messaging delays. When the delays become too long error mitigation actions can be taken to improve system performance. Detection of message delays is input to the selection of the correct OVERLOAD TOOLBOX (42) of mitigation techniques that should be employed.

Heartbeats are useful when the monitor is a person. The IBM TSS operating system had a command called ‘BLEEP’ that added one dot to the display every few seconds. This gave an indication that something was actually happening. Today’s operating systems provide spinning disks or spinning hourglasses to reassure the human System Monitors that the monitored task is still working. …

Information that a task has failed is only needed when the task is in use. If the task is unneeded the failure may remain latent and wait for some other mechanism to detect and correct it later. Detection does not always need to occur immediately, although faster detection leads to faster resolution. For example, in some cases the system only needs to know if a crash failure has occurred when it tries to use the crashed, monitored task, for example a daily report writing task.

> 只有当任务正在使用时，才需要任务失败的信息。如果不需要任务，则故障可能会保持潜伏状态，并等待其他机制检测并稍后纠正。检测并不总是需要立即发生，尽管更快的检测导致更快的分辨率。例如，在某些情况下，系统只需要在尝试使用崩溃的受监控任务（例如每日报告编写任务）时知道是否发生了崩溃故障。

Normal operations consist of a request (a query or instruction) from one task to another. It may or may not have a reply (an answer or a completion report). The target of the request (the task that will perform the action and possibly reply) is the system to be monitored. This could be either a client-server system or a system that requires peer to peer communication. In these systems there is a message flow that creates a two way dialog between the tasks.

> 正常操作包括从一个任务到另一个任务的请求（查询或指令）。它可能有也可能没有答复（答复或完成报告）。请求的目标（将执行操作并可能回复的任务）是要监视的系统。这可以是客户端-服务器系统，也可以是需要对等通信的系统。在这些系统中，有一个消息流在任务之间创建双向对话。

Messages have overhead associated with them. Adding extra messages to the system increases the bandwidth requirements and has the potential to delay more important information.

An easy way is to add acknowledging information to a reply that is (or will be) sent. This is referred to as piggybacking. \[Tan81\]. This results in some additional complexity in both parties. The logic will be required in the requestor that looks for valid information in the acknowledgement. The monitored system might be asked to add some special information if it is aware that it is being monitored. If the monitored system is not aware that it is being watched then there might be no extra complexity required on its side.

> 一种简单的方法是将确认信息添加到已发送（或将发送）的回复中。这被称为背负\[Tan81\]。这会给双方带来一些额外的复杂性。请求者需要在确认中查找有效信息的逻辑。如果被监控的系统知道它正在被监控，可能会被要求添加一些特殊信息。如果被监视的系统不知道它正在被监视，那么可能不需要额外的复杂性。

A disadvantage of using the reply is that if there aren’t requests then there aren’t replies that can report a status. Even though information about a failure is only needed when a task is needed, if the system has the information earlier the failing task can be restored before it is needed.

> 使用回复的一个缺点是，如果没有请求，那么就没有可以报告状态的回复。尽管只有在需要任务时才需要有关失败的信息，但如果系统更早地获得了信息，则可以在需要之前恢复失败的任务。

If the request will take a long time then the requestor might think that the request has died. In these cases an interim acknowledgement that merely acknowledges receipt of the request can help. A response to the reply will be sent later, when the request completes.

> 如果请求需要很长时间，那么请求者可能会认为请求已终止。在这些情况下，仅确认收到请求的临时确认会有所帮助。稍后将在请求完成时发送对答复的响应。

There are a number of different contexts in which this pattern will apply. They represent different dimensions in your architecture; not all of them need to be met for this to be the correct pattern: You can’t spare messaging or processing cycles to add new, piggybacked messages that you’d have to add if you implemented HEARTBEATS (16), or you might have the ability to add special hardware to implement the monitoring functionality.

> 这种模式将应用于许多不同的环境。它们代表了架构中的不同维度；并不是所有这些都需要满足才能成为正确的模式：如果你实现了 HEARTBEATS（16），你不能腾出消息或处理周期来添加新的附带消息，或者你可能有能力添加特殊硬件来实现监控功能。

**How can the system ensure a task is alive with a simple mechanism and you can’t or don’t want to add to messaging or processing overhead?**

> **系统如何通过简单的机制确保任务处于活动状态，而您不能或不想增加消息传递或处理开销**

The first thought is to have the monitored function report its status. The patterns HEARTBEAT (16) and ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (17) add extra messages, or at least extra information to existing messages to report that the monitored task is actually working. But in many circumstances the messaging bandwidth has already been designed too small for the application and you just can’t add in any new messages. And if something is faulty it may not report its state correctly. Status reporting capability adds complexity, and hence the chance for additional faults.

> 第一个想法是让被监控的功能报告其状态。模式 HEARTBEAT（16）和 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT（17）向现有消息添加额外的消息，或至少添加额外的信息，以报告所监视的任务实际上正在工作。但在许多情况下，消息传递带宽对于应用程序来说已经设计得太小了，您无法添加任何新消息。如果有问题，它可能无法正确报告其状态。状态报告功能增加了复杂性，从而增加了发生额外故障的机会。

If you can’t add messages to the system, you can add checks on the validity of the monitored tasks operations. One way discussed in other patterns is the redundancy based detection of errors. Perhaps the system can verify the results with another copy in parallel through N-Version Programming or sequentially through RECOVERY BLOCKS (4). However these techniques are very expensive, in terms of both processing resources and complexity.

> 如果无法向系统添加消息，则可以添加对受监视任务操作有效性的检查。其他模式中讨论的一种方法是基于冗余的错误检测。也许系统可以通过 N 版本编程并行地或通过 RECOVERY BLOCKS（4）顺序地用另一个副本验证结果。然而，就处理资源和复杂性而言，这些技术非常昂贵。

One way of monitoring the system without increasing the complexity is to watch activities that happen routinely. For example, the monitoring task can watch to ensure that the communications are happening as expected. The monitor can ride on the coat tails of the monitored activities. Are messages going both ways? Are they frequent enough? The monitor doesn’t become part of the message stream, it watches from afar.

> 在不增加复杂性的情况下监控系统的一种方法是监视经常发生的活动。例如，监控任务可以监视以确保通信按预期进行。监视器可以在被监视活动的尾部进行监视。消息是双向的吗？他们是否足够频繁？监视器不会成为消息流的一部分，而是在远处监视。

Another technique that adds only a little to the complexity of the system is to set a hardware time before a critical operation is started. At the end of the operation the timer is checked to determine if the timing was within acceptable limits. The timer can also be checked while the critical operation is proceeding to detect that it has not completed within acceptable limits.

> 另一种增加系统复杂性的技术是在关键操作开始之前设置硬件时间。在操作结束时，检查计时器以确定计时是否在可接受的范围内。在关键操作进行时，也可以检查计时器，以检测其未在可接受的范围内完成。

Sometimes you can add new hardware to the design. A simple hardware component that will watch the monitored task’s execution can be built. It might monitor the control leads of a microcontroller, or it might watch a word in memory that the task is known to use, or it could be a passive observer watching an exchange of messages.

> 有时您可以在设计中添加新硬件。可以构建一个简单的硬件组件来监视被监视任务的执行。它可能会监控微控制器的控制引线，或者它可能会在内存中观察任务已知使用的单词，或者它可以是一个被动的观察者，观察消息的交换。

Even if new hardware cannot be added the monitor can watch some kinds of things from another process on the same processor or even from another general purpose processor (as contrasted with dedicated watching hardware).

This pattern is very similar to SYSTEM MONITOR (15). A key difference is that a SYSTEM MONITOR watches a number of tasks, whereas a WATCHDOG is assigned to monitor only one. Typically a WATCHDOG will report to a System Monitor and to a FAULT OBSERVER (10) when the WATCHDOG detects a failure.

Two different times are of interest, detection latency and messaging latency, see <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.36" id="c05.htm#fig5.36a">Figure 36</a>. Both require some care in choosing their values. _Detection latency_ refers to how long the monitor, e.g. the SYSTEM MONITOR (15), should wait for a response before taking action. _Messaging latency_ refers to the time between queries to determine the status of the monitored task. Detection latency values are typically expressed as an integer multiple of the Messaging latency. For example, the detection latency might be N missed messages and each of these N messages is sent ‘messaging latency’ apart.

> 检测延迟和消息传递延迟是两个不同的时间，请参见图 36</a>。两者在选择价值观时都需要谨慎*检测延迟*是指监视器（例如系统监视器（15））在采取行动之前应等待响应的时间*消息传递延迟（Messaging latency*）是指确定受监视任务状态的查询之间的时间。检测延迟值通常表示为消息传递延迟的整数倍。例如，检测延迟可能是 N 条错过的消息，而这 N 条消息中的每一条都是“消息延迟”发送的。

> **[图 36]（#c05.htm#fig5.36a）**延迟术语

![](./OEBPS/images/110-2.jpg)

Poorly chosen values of either detection latency or messaging latency will result in poor system performance. If either the messaging latency or the detection latency is too short the monitor is hypersensitive to minor interruptions. If they are too long the effectiveness of the monitor is diminished, because too many errors can occur before any error is detected. <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.37" id="c05.htm#fig5.37a">Figure 37</a> shows these possibilities.

> 检测延迟或消息传递延迟的值选择不当将导致系统性能不佳。如果消息传递延迟或检测延迟太短，则监视器对轻微中断非常敏感。如果它们太长，监视器的有效性就会降低，因为在检测到任何错误之前可能会发生太多错误 <a href=“#c05.htm#fig5.37”id=“c05.htm#fig5.37a”> 图 37</a>显示了这些可能性。

For example, consider a system with the following parameters. The best case message round trip time from the monitoring task to the monitored task is 50 microseconds, and the worst case is 100 microseconds. The time is the same in both directions, so each message takes either 25 or 50 microseconds respectively. The monitoring task takes 20 microseconds to prepare a HEARTBEAT (16) message and 15 microseconds to process the reply message. It takes the monitored task 15 microseconds to process the HEARTBEAT and to reply to the monitor. For simplicity of the example assume that missing one message will result in the detection of a failure, and so the detection latency is set to one missed message.

> 例如，考虑具有以下参数的系统。从监控任务到监控任务的最佳消息往返时间为 50 微秒，最坏情况为 100 微秒。两个方向的时间相同，因此每条消息分别需要 25 或 50 微秒。监控任务需要 20 微秒来准备 HEARTBEAT（16）消息，并且需要 15 微秒来处理回复消息。被监视的任务需要 15 微秒来处理 HEARTBEAT 并回复监视器。为了简化示例，假设丢失一条消息将导致检测到故障，因此检测延迟设置为一条丢失消息。

With the example numbers above, if the messaging latency is set to 50 microseconds then failures will always be reported because this only accounts for the best case message passing time. It does not include the time required to process the messages, which totals to 50 microseconds. If the messaging latency is set to 1000 microseconds then even with the worst case message round trip time, the message will have been returned and allowance for processing time has been made. But in this case, with a 1000 microsecond messaging latency time, the monitored task might have failed up to 1940 microseconds before detection. This is because failure might have occurred immediately after sending a reply to a heartbeat message, at time 60 microseconds, but it will be the next heartbeat, sent at time 1020 microseconds, that won’t be returned and even that won’t be detected until the next heartbeat is about to be sent at time 2000 microseconds. <a href="#c05.htm#tab5.2" id="c05.htm#tab5.2a">Table 5.2</a> illustrates the timing for this case.

> 对于上面的示例数字，如果消息传递延迟设置为 50 微秒，那么将始终报告失败，因为这只占最佳消息传递时间。它不包括处理消息所需的时间，总共 50 微秒。如果消息传递延迟设置为 1000 微秒，那么即使在最坏的情况下消息往返时间，消息也将被返回，并已留出处理时间。但在这种情况下，由于消息传递延迟时间为 1000 微秒，被监视的任务可能在检测之前失败了 1940 微秒。这是因为，在发送心跳消息的回复后，在 60 微秒时可能会立即发生故障，但在 1020 微秒时发送的下一个心跳将不会被返回，甚至在 2000 微秒时将要发送下一个心动之前也不会被检测到 <a href=“#c05.htm#tab5.2”id=“c05.ht#tab5.2a”> 表 5.2</a>说明了这种情况的时间。

If the task being monitored has parallel instances that can share the load while it is not working, especially with automatic load distribution by some other entity, then the detection latency time can be longer because load sharing mechanisms will adapt automatically to a failed instance.

> 如果正在监视的任务具有并行实例，这些实例可以在其不工作时共享负载，特别是在某些其他实体自动分配负载的情况下，则检测延迟时间可能更长，因为负载共享机制将自动适应失败的实例。

The messaging latency in this pattern is almost always slightly greater than the communications round trip time. One reason is that having an excessive number of status messages in the system is considered a drain on resources, so generally the system should wait for a message to return or time out before sending the next message.

> 这种模式中的消息传递延迟几乎总是略大于通信往返时间。一个原因是，在系统中有过多的状态消息被认为是资源的消耗，因此通常系统应该等待消息返回或超时，然后再发送下一个消息。

A minimal messaging latency is:

> 最小消息传递延迟为：

The worst-case communications round trip time;

> 最坏情况下的通信往返时间；

- the processing time at the component being monitored;

> -所述部件处的处理时间被监控；

- the processing time at the monitor.

> -监视器上的处理时间。

This requires the monitor to be waiting for and processing only one status message at a time. If the monitor is not able to process the message immediately then you should also factor its delay to start processing.

> 这要求监视器一次只能等待和处理一条状态消息。如果监视器无法立即处理消息，则还应考虑其延迟以开始处理。

A minimal detection latency value is one messaging latency interval. Setting detection latency to be equal to one messaging latency interval makes a very unforgiving system. Any errors at all will trigger an error report. Unexpected communications messaging latencies as well as slow target processing can result in errors being reported when the target has not failed.

> 最小检测延迟值是一个消息传递延迟间隔。将检测延迟设置为等于一个消息传递延迟间隔，会使系统变得非常无情。任何错误都会触发错误报告。意外的通信消息传递延迟以及缓慢的目标处理可能会导致在目标未失败时报告错误。

Typically, however, the detection latency is set to be a small number of messaging latency times. For example, an error might be reported when three status messages have been missed.

> 然而，通常将检测延迟设置为少量消息传递延迟时间。例如，当错过三条状态消息时，可能会报告错误。

The system can also be programmed to automatically and dynamically adjust the threshold values based on workload and feedback from the various system parts.

> 该系统还可以被编程为基于工作负载和来自各个系统部件的反馈来自动和动态地调整阈值。

Here are some examples of real thresholds. The attitude computer on the Voyager spacecraft sends a heartbeat to the command computer every two seconds which detects a failure when one heartbeat is skipped. The frequency of checking was determined based upon an overload condition detected in tests using one second heartbeats. During the time between heartbeats the attitude control computer performs self checks. If any checks fail it does not send a heartbeat to the command computer. \[Tom88\]

> 下面是一些实际阈值的示例。旅行者号飞船上的姿态计算机每两秒向指挥计算机发送一次心跳，当跳过一次心跳时，指挥计算机就会检测到故障。检查频率是根据在使用 1 秒心跳的测试中检测到的过载情况确定的。在心跳之间的时间内，姿态控制计算机执行自检。如果任何检查失败，它不会向命令计算机发送心跳\[Tom88\]

Within the 4ESS™ Switch there is a heartbeat between the main call processing processor, the ‘1B’, and the Direct Link Node or DLN, a processor that interfaces to an attached token ring network that is used for external signaling. Since the heartbeat messages checked both that the DLN was still functioning, as well as measuring the congestion, a complicated heartbeat system was created. The message round trip time was determined to be about 100 milliseconds in the best case, with messages being sent every 120 milliseconds. The detection latency was set to be three missed messages. Since the heartbeat was also measuring congestion on the message path, the length of time that the messages took from the 1B to the DLN and back to the 1B was also used to trigger various error mitigation (overload) controls in an example of EXISTING METRICS (20) \[GHJ98\]. …

> 4ESS 内 ™ 切换主呼叫处理处理器“1B”和直接链路节点（DLN）之间的心跳，DLN 是连接到用于外部信令的附加令牌环网络的处理器。由于心跳消息检查 DLN 是否仍在运行，以及测量拥塞，因此创建了一个复杂的心跳系统。在最佳情况下，消息往返时间被确定为大约 100 毫秒，消息每 120 毫秒发送一次。检测延迟设置为三条错过的消息。由于心跳也在测量消息路径上的拥塞，因此在现有 METRICS（20）\[GHJ98\]的示例中，消息从 1B 到 DLN 再返回到 1B 所花费的时间长度也用于触发各种错误缓解（过载）控制…

… The problem appears to be that more resources are needed than are available to process the workload. Depending on the system design the appearance of an overload can take different forms.

> ……问题似乎是需要的资源多于处理工作负载所需的资源。根据系统设计，过载的外观可以采取不同的形式。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**How should we judge the severity of too many resource requests? Is there any way that the system might measure how the severity of an overload without contributing to the overload?**

> **我们应该如何判断过多资源请求的严重性？系统是否有任何方法可以在不造成过载的情况下测量过载的严重程度**

Indicators can be created to measure the severity of the overload. Adding them to the system can give extremely accurate measures of the resource requests and of the availability of resources. But computing the indicators introduces additional overhead into the system. The system is already overloaded so this is a bad time to add overhead work.

> 可以创建指示器来测量过载的严重程度。将它们添加到系统中可以非常准确地衡量资源请求和资源可用性。但计算指标会给系统带来额外的开销。系统已经过载，所以现在不是增加开销的好时机。

You want to let the system process the arriving workload as best as it can. The system shouldn’t waste time on work that is unnecessary. This is discussed more in DEFERRABLE WORK (43).

> 您希望让系统尽可能地处理到达的工作量。系统不应将时间浪费在不必要的工作上。这在《可防御工作》（43）中有更多讨论。

When the system is working and processing the maximum workload that it can is also a bad time for an error to occur. Adding special software that will work primarily when the system is overloaded is risky because there might be latent faults within the section of code that is only executed during overload.

> 当系统工作并处理最大工作负载时，也是发生错误的好时机。添加主要在系统过载时工作的特殊软件是有风险的，因为只有在过载期间才执行的代码部分可能存在潜在错误。

The operating system and other infrastructure parts have a variety of measurements built in. The system can use already existing indicators. Some indicators such as per cent CPU idle time can be used. This does not increase overhead, since the data is already available. The CPU idle time or alternately the processor occupancy is a metric that system designers include as a measure of workload and its variability.

> 操作系统和其他基础设施部分内置了各种测量。系统可以使用现有的指标。可以使用 CPU 空闲时间百分比等一些指标。这不会增加开销，因为数据已经可用。CPU 空闲时间或处理器占用率是系统设计者用来衡量工作负载及其可变性的指标。

These already existing indicators might not contain precisely the information that is needed to control the system’s overload. Instead of basing control decisions on the measure of average time spent to handle each request that succeeds, the percentage CPU occupancy can be used. It doesn’t directly report the time per request; it instead offers only an indication of the total system workload. But the time per request requires the collection of request duration and arithmetic on it to determine the metric. Processor occupancy is readily available within the system.

> 这些已经存在的指示器可能不准确地包含控制系统过载所需的信息。可以使用 CPU 占用率，而不是基于处理每个成功请求所花费的平均时间来进行控制决策。它不直接报告每个请求的时间；相反，它只提供总系统工作负载的指示。但是，每个请求的时间需要收集请求持续时间并对其进行运算，以确定度量。处理器占用率在系统内随时可用。

HEARTBEAT (16) and ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (17) messages are regular messages that can be expected in a system that employs those techniques. The amount of time that they take to travel across the system can serve as an indicator of messaging path congestion. This mechanism is used in the 4ESS™ Switch over a circuitous message path between two processors that goes through another processor along the way. When the time becomes excessive, overload controlling error mitigation is initiated.

> HEARTBEAT（16）和 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT（17）消息是在使用这些技术的系统中可以预期的常规消息。它们在系统中运行所花费的时间可以作为消息传递路径拥塞的指标。该机制用于 4ESS™ 在两个处理器之间切换一条迂回的消息路径，该路径沿途经过另一个处理器。当时间过长时，启动过载控制错误缓解。

Therefore:

… REDUNDANCY (3) exists in the system. Not just any redundancy, but some sort of redundancy that provides multiple answers. This could be multiple hardware units working on the same problem and computing the answers separately. It might also apply to having multiple copies of a software element, all computing the same result in parallel.

> …系统中存在冗余（3）。不只是任何冗余，而是提供多种答案的某种冗余。这可能是多个硬件单元在处理同一个问题并分别计算答案。它也可能适用于一个软件元素的多个副本，所有副本都并行计算相同的结果。

> 安装 REDUNDANCY（3）的最初原因是，您担心冗余元素可能存在潜在故障，从而使其无法正常运行。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**The system has multiple answers. How does it know what answer should be used?**

> **系统有多个答案。它如何知道应该使用什么答案**

With multiple versions of an answer how does the system know which one is correct? Refer to [Table 1.2](#c01.htm#tab1.2) in Chapter 1 which shows how many elements are needed to support certain numbers of faults/errors, for example 3n+1 to survive malicious failures. Deciding which of the responses is correct is a difficult problem.

> 对于多个版本的答案，系统如何知道哪一个是正确的？请参阅第 1 章中的[表 1.2]（#c01.htm#tab1.2），其中显示了需要多少元素来支持特定数量的故障/错误，例如 3n+1 以避免恶意故障。决定哪一个答案是正确的是一个难题。

Deciding a granularity level of redundant results to choose the answer is sometimes decided during the architectural design phase based upon the UNITS OF MITIGATION (1), but it is generally decided during design time. Smaller granularity provides simpler results, and the choices of acceptable alternatives will be smaller. Computing multiple versions of a result for comparison will use less processing resources because the computations are small. Comparisons at a higher level of abstraction are more likely to result in multiple correct results, but if there is variation in the computations the results are less likely to be identical. \[Tor00\]

> 确定冗余结果的粒度级别以选择答案有时是在架构设计阶段根据缓解单元（1）决定的，但通常是在设计阶段决定的。粒度越小，结果越简单，可接受的替代方案的选择也越少。计算结果的多个版本进行比较将使用较少的处理资源，因为计算量较小。较高抽象级别的比较更有可能产生多个正确的结果，但如果计算中存在差异，则结果不太可能相同\[扭矩\]

You could make an assumption about which would be correct, for example that the ‘active’ element is the one that should be trusted. When there’s a disagreement this rule identifies that the ‘standby’ or secondary active element is the one with the fault. In order for this to work methods such as ROUTINE EXERCISES (23) are required to periodically check that the ‘active’ is working correctly. If the system does not, it can get into the situation where the ‘active’ is the one with the fault, but the “’standby’ is constantly being told that it’s at fault, and is isolated from service to enable its (non-existent) faults to be treated.

> 您可以假设哪一个是正确的，例如，“active”元素是应该被信任的元素。当出现分歧时，该规则确定“备用”或辅助激活元件是故障元件。为了使其发挥作用，需要定期检查“活动”是否正常工作，如常规锻炼（23）。如果系统没有这样做，它可能会进入这样一种情况，即“活动”是有故障的，但“待机”总是被告知它有故障，并与服务隔离，以使其（不存在的）故障得到处理。

In some cases the ‘answers’ that need to be compared are quite large. This can pose a problem in network bandwidth, storage space, or timing to receive and compare. In cases like this a CHECKSUM (25) can be used to reduce the quantity of resources needed to decide. The Space Shuttle flight controls use checksums on the outputs of the four computers generating their commands to assess validity. \[Skl76\]

> 在某些情况下，需要比较的“答案”非常大。这可能会在网络带宽、存储空间或接收和比较的时间方面造成问题。在这种情况下，可以使用 CHECKSUM（25）来减少需要决定的资源量。航天飞机飞行控制使用四台计算机输出的校验和来生成指令，以评估其有效性\[Skl76\]

In some cases the answers that resulted from the various sources can be expected to be identical, for example integers or characters. In some cases however the results may deviate in ways that prevent direct comparison. The deviations can occur either due to inexact hardware representations, for example slight differences in floating point numbers, or the deviation can result from inadequate design or algorithm implementation. Chen and Avizienis \[CA78\] describe two ways of handling the cases where inexact voting is required. Adaptive voting schemes predict the results based upon past experience. These mechanisms work by predicting what the correct value should be and then taking the computational result that is closest to the predicted value. \[Tor00\] In one method, a weighted sum of the results is computed: \[CA78\]

> 在某些情况下，来自不同来源的答案可能是相同的，例如整数或字符。然而，在某些情况下，结果可能会出现偏差，从而妨碍直接比较。这些偏差可能是由于硬件表示不精确，例如浮点数的微小差异，或者是由于设计或算法实现不充分而导致的。Chen 和 Avizienis\[CA78\]描述了处理需要不精确投票的情况的两种方法。自适应投票方案基于过去的经验预测结果。这些机制的工作原理是预测正确的值，然后得到最接近预测值的计算结果\[Tor00\]在一种方法中，计算结果的加权和：\[CA78\]

Where the results to be compared are the Ri variables and the Wi’s are weights that are computed in a way to minimize the impact of erroneous Ri’s. The Wi’s are all positive and they sum to one. This requires a computation to arrive at the result, which can be quite slow. If the computed result, R, is used in further computations the system needs to ensure that the errors present in the results do not accumulate.

> 其中要比较的结果是 Ri 变量，Wi 是以最小化错误 Ri 的影响的方式计算的权重。Wi 都是正的，加起来就是 1。这需要计算才能得出结果，这可能非常缓慢。如果在进一步计算中使用计算结果 R，则系统需要确保结果中存在的误差不会累积。

In non-adaptive voting an allowable discrepancy between the results to be compared is used to arrive at the correct result. Non-adaptive voting can be implemented by comparing the maximums or minimums of the differences between values with a threshold. If the results to be voted upon are all close to each other then any of the results can be used for continued processing. If the results diverge wildly, even if only a minority of them diverges, then the comparison will report the diverging value and some form of recovery or recalculation can begin. Choosing to use maximum or minimum is based on the context of the situation and the most likely types of deviations expected to be seen:

> 在非自适应投票中，使用待比较结果之间的允许差异来获得正确结果。可以通过将值之间的差异的最大值或最小值与阈值进行比较来实现非自适应投票。如果要投票的结果彼此接近，则任何结果都可以用于继续处理。如果结果差异很大，即使只有少数结果出现差异，那么比较将报告差异值，并且可以开始某种形式的恢复或重新计算。选择使用最大值或最小值取决于情况的背景和预计出现的最可能的偏差类型：

There are cases where neither of these equations will ever succeed in finding a result. In order to use these you must know something about the data sensitivity of the algorithms in use, the capabilities and limitations of the computational hardware, and allowable thresholds.

> 在某些情况下，这两个方程都无法找到结果。为了使用这些，您必须了解所使用算法的数据敏感性、计算硬件的功能和限制以及允许的阈值。

Care must be taken to prevent any communications message latency from affecting the results of the voting. For example if the responses to be compared must travel some distance over a network before the comparison, appropriate waits and latches must be used to ensure that correct pairs of information are compared.

> 必须小心防止任何通信消息延迟影响投票结果。例如，如果要比较的响应在比较之前必须在网络上行进一定距离，则必须使用适当的等待和锁存器来确保比较正确的信息对。

If there are more than two elements performing the calculation, for example in a system with triple modular redundancy, then a simple strategy is to conduct a majority vote to determine which computation is correct. These work with any number of elements greater than two, but beware of the scenario where there is no majority and the vote is evenly split. Four units can get into this situation where two can vote on each of the possible answers.

> 如果有两个以上的元素执行计算，例如在具有三模块冗余的系统中，那么一个简单的策略是进行多数表决以确定哪个计算是正确的。这些方法适用于任意数量的大于两个的元素，但要注意没有多数票且选票均等的情况。四个单元可以进入这种情况，两个单元可以对每个可能的答案进行投票。

Other methods for selection in cases of multiple elements are generalized median voting, formalized plurality voting, and the weighted average technique discussed above. Generalized median voting selects the result that is the median of the computations by iteratively removing from consideration the extreme values. Formalized plurality voting divides the calculations into partitions based upon their value. An element is chosen at random from the partition that has the largest number of members. \[LCE89\]

> 在多个元素的情况下选择的其他方法是广义中值投票、形式化的多个投票和上面讨论的加权平均技术。广义中值投票通过迭代去除极值来选择作为计算中值的结果。形式化的多人投票根据其值将计算划分为多个分区。从成员数最多的分区中随机选择一个元素\[LCE89\]

Care must be taken if the voting is between results that are different yet correct. For example if the result is a grouping of data without a specified order then there can be more than one correct solution. A means of choosing one of the results must be designed.

> 如果投票结果不同但正确，则必须小心。例如，如果结果是一组没有指定顺序的数据，那么可以有多个正确的解决方案。必须设计一种选择结果之一的方法。

Computer programs are generally deterministic, unless there are faults active. In the case of the redundancy presented at the beginning of this pattern any disagreement in the computation is the sign of an error. This is based on two assumptions. The first is that the redundant elements were given the same inputs. The second is that the elements were designed to produce the same results when given the same inputs. If these assumptions are true then any disagreement must be a sign of error.

> 除非存在活动故障，否则计算机程序通常是确定性的。在这种模式开始时出现冗余的情况下，计算中的任何不一致都是错误的标志。这基于两个假设。第一个是冗余元素被赋予相同的输入。第二个是，当给定相同的输入时，这些元素被设计为产生相同的结果。如果这些假设是正确的，那么任何不一致都是错误的标志。

Voting mechanisms of necessity cannot check for specific correct answers. They must instead check for whether the results are acceptable or consistent. \[Tor00\]

Memory leaks are a type of fault that occur in many systems. In general terms a memory leak is a loss of finite resources due to faults. When these faults are detected early, the system can prevent errors and failures by not allowing the fault to activate. The leak might occur because of a design or coding fault, or it might result from a failure to adequately FINAL HANDLE (50) requests. Unchecked memory leaks usually lead to failures. Periodic checks of memory usage and memory loss allow the system to return the resources to the available pool preventing errors.

Many operating systems and scheduling regimes make use of a system idle process to ‘eat up’ time not used by the actual process work. Low priority tasks can be run during this time to perform preventive maintenance on the system. One way of scheduling a routine task is to use a low priority in a multi-priority scheduler. The system can access the data and determine its correctness (i.e. whether it is fault-free). If it is not fault-free then either correct it or report the error and initiate error processing. If these audits are done in a low priority maintenance task, when the application gets busy, defer the work. This is discussed in DEFERRABLE WORK (43).

This applies to the Active-Standby and N + M REDUNDANCY (3) schemes.

> **您如何知道在发生错误或故障时，FAILOVER（36）将调用进入服务的冗余（3）元素将实际工作**

Failure-free operations do not exercise all of the hardware or all of the software in a system. Some of the hardware and software are intended for operation only when there has been a failure. Without periodic usage these components do not have the opportunity to report problems with their use.

> 无故障操作不会使用系统中的所有硬件或所有软件。某些硬件和软件仅用于发生故障时的操作。如果没有定期使用，这些组件就没有机会报告使用中的问题。

You can blindly assume that the standby will be perfectly functional but that does not conform to the Fault Tolerant Mindset. Or you can assume that they might be broken and will not work. In that case, you should fix them before they are required to perform.

> 您可以盲目地假设待机将完全正常，但这不符合容错思维。或者你可以假设它们可能坏了，无法工作。在这种情况下，您应该在要求它们执行之前修复它们。

No tests are infallible. So even the best designed test might not identify latent faults. And since you can’t stop the system to check everything for latent faults you can’t perform very invasive tests.

> 没有任何测试是绝对正确的。因此，即使是设计最好的测试也可能无法识别潜在故障。而且，由于您无法停止系统检查所有潜在故障，因此无法执行非常侵入性的测试。

Checking for latent faults can be accomplished by using the standby element to execute the application. Make the standby become the active unit. If it is fault-free then it should safely handle the whole load. If it has latent errors then it will fail. But then you know that it has a fault and shouldn’t be trusted. Perform a FAILOVER (36) and go back to the previous state.

> 通过使用备用元件执行应用程序，可以完成对潜在故障的检查。使待机状态变为活动状态。如果它是无故障的，那么它应该安全地处理整个负载。如果它有潜在的错误，那么它将失败。但你知道它有缺陷，不应该被信任。执行故障切换（36）并返回到先前状态。

An effective way to detect hardware transient faults is to perform the same execution at different times. \[Kop97\]

> 检测硬件瞬时故障的有效方法是在不同时间执行相同的执行\[Kop97\]

When an error occurs and a fault is identified in a component, the newly active unit should be removed from service to enable the service personnel to correct the fault. This leaves the system vulnerable to failures in the active components in a duplicated system that now has no standby REDUNDANCY (3). This problem is addressed by running ROUTINE EXERCISES during periods of relatively light workload.

> 当发生错误并且在部件中识别出故障时，应将新激活的单元从服务中移除，以使服务人员能够纠正故障。这使得系统容易受到复制系统中活动组件故障的影响，而复制系统现在没有备用冗余（3）。这个问题可以通过在工作量相对较轻的时期进行常规锻炼来解决。

When FAILOVER (36) to the standby is made to perform its routine exercises it should be monitored for a short period to see if it will fail. If no error occurs, allow the previous active, now the standby, unit to execute any of its built in tests or other diagnostic tests. This ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (22) will help it to be more trustworthy when it is made active again.

> 当故障切换（36）至备用状态以执行其常规练习时，应短时间监控其是否会故障。如果没有发生错误，则允许前一个活动单元（现在是备用单元）执行任何内置测试或其他诊断测试。此例行维护（22）将帮助其在再次激活时更加可靠。

Therefore,

> 因此

**Routinely exercise, or execute, the system components that will be required in an error situation. This will identify those components that have latent faults. The faults can then be corrected before a failure occurs that requires the faulty component to be used for real operation. See <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.42" id="c05.htm#fig5.42a">Figure 42</a>.**

Generally this pattern applies to hardware units, although standby software modules can be exercised also.

> 通常，这种模式适用于硬件单元，但也可以使用备用软件模块。

After ROUTINE EXERCISES have been done the system can merely diagnose the units and leave them on standby, or it can diagnose then and make them active again.

When ROUTINE EXERCISES are performed, errors can occur. This is the goal of the routine exercise, but it is better to have a REPRODUCIBLE ERROR (60) uncover the error and the existence of a fault than to have the error occur when you can’t be certain that the standby itself will be fault-free. Sometimes the system owner will complain about errors being unearthed. The response to this complaint is to point out that the alternative would be much more severe, namely a failure during normal operation, perhaps during a busy period. In general, execute the ROUTINE EXERCISES during periods of low activity.

… The system has some idle time during which it can perform ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (22). Even though it might have real-time deadlines, there is some idle time that can be allocated.

> …系统有一些空闲时间，在此期间可以执行例行维护（22）。尽管它可能有实时截止日期，但仍有一些空闲时间可以分配。

The system employs CORRECTING AUDITS (2) to detect and correct erroneous data.

> 系统采用纠正审计（2）来检测和纠正错误数据。

**Faulty data can exist in the system for a long time before it causes errors.**

> **错误数据可能在系统中存在很长时间，然后才会导致错误**

Bad data is faulty. It causes errors in the system, for example incorrect computations, incorrect actions. Faulty data easily propagates throughout the system.

> 错误数据是错误的。它会导致系统错误，例如错误的计算、错误的操作。错误数据很容易在整个系统中传播。

When the period of time between detection and recovery is long, there is a larger chance of another task using the erroneous data and making an erroneous (and possibly failing) decision with it.

> 当检测和恢复之间的时间间隔较长时，另一个任务使用错误数据并做出错误（可能失败）决策的可能性较大。

It is much more desirable to find data faults and errors in a controlled way than to encounter them in normal operations. This is the data equivalent of a fail-silent failure. If found unexpectedly then the data might propagate to other parts of the system and cause other failures.

> 以可控的方式查找数据故障和错误比在正常操作中遇到它们更可取。这是相当于无故障故障的数据。如果意外发现，则数据可能传播到系统的其他部分并导致其他故障。

Checking all the data in a system for faults takes time. The system can penalize each data access by checking for errors at that point, which is similar to COMPLETE PARAMETER CHECKING (14). Or the checking can be done at a time when normal processing won’t be effected. This might be in an idle time slot, or it might be during the execution of a maintenance task. Good performance engineering recommends that processors not be scheduled for full processor occupancy, so there is some capacity available for ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (22).

> 检查系统中的所有数据是否存在故障需要时间。系统可以通过检查该点的错误来惩罚每次数据访问，这类似于完全参数检查（14）。或者，可以在不影响正常处理的时间进行检查。这可能是在空闲时间段，也可能是在执行维护任务期间。良好的性能工程建议不要将处理器安排为完全占用处理器，因此有一些容量可用于日常维护（22）。

Many operating systems and scheduling regimes make use of a system idle process to ‘eat up’ time not used by the actual process work. Low priority tasks can be run during this time to perform ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (22) on the system. One way of scheduling a routine task is to use a low priority in a multi priority scheduler. The system can access the data and determine its correctness (i.e. whether it is fault-free). If it is not fault-free then either correct it or report the error and initiate error processing. If these audits are done in a low priority maintenance task, when the application gets busy, defer the work. This is discussed in DEFERRABLE WORK (43).

> 许多操作系统和调度机制利用系统空闲进程来“消耗”实际进程工作未使用的时间。在此期间可以运行低优先级任务，以在系统上执行例行维护（22）。调度例程任务的一种方法是在多优先级调度器中使用低优先级。系统可以访问数据并确定其正确性（即是否无故障）。如果它不是无故障的，则纠正它或报告错误并启动错误处理。如果这些审计是在低优先级维护任务中完成的，那么当应用程序变得繁忙时，请推迟工作。这在《可防御工作》（43）中进行了讨论。

Where there’s one error in data there might be others. When a data error is detected a prudent step is to consider what other data might be erroneous. The detected error might be the result of a number of computations that should all be considered suspicious and checked for errors.

> 如果数据中有一个错误，可能会有其他错误。当检测到数据错误时，谨慎的步骤是考虑哪些其他数据可能是错误的。检测到的错误可能是大量计算的结果，这些计算都应被视为可疑并检查错误。

Any detection of data errors should be logged to allow for causal analysis, so the occurrences should be reported to the FAULT OBSERVER (10).

… The system is fault tolerant so it detects and processes data errors. CORRECTING AUDITS (2) is the usual mechanism. The data might come from memory, or from the receipt of a message. Erroneous data needs detection.

> …该系统是容错的，因此它可以检测和处理数据错误。纠正审计（2）是通常的机制。数据可能来自内存，也可能来自消息的接收。错误数据需要检测。

_Data_ in this pattern can be a structure or an aggregation; it does not need to refer to a single value.

> *此模式中的数据*可以是结构或聚合；它不需要引用单个值。

One of the ways to detect incorrect data values is to store redundant information along with the value to be monitored.

> 检测错误数据值的方法之一是将冗余信息与要监视的值一起存储。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**How can we detect that a data value is incorrect?**

> **我们如何检测数据值不正确**

The structure and contents of the data that needs to be correct in order to be fault tolerant spans a wide continuum of size from individual bits to large blocks of memory.

> 为了容错，数据的结构和内容需要正确，从单个位到大的内存块，数据的大小范围很广。

Maintaining a redundant copy of a data element in some place or manner that it can’t be changed enables detection of an incorrect data value. When a question of correctness is asked the value can be compared to the unchangeable copy; if they do not match one is in error. But that is impractical in many cases. Depending on the application algorithm you might not know in advance what data to save unchangeable copies for. A more practical reason to not save unchangeable copies is the amount of memory that would be consumed to store a duplicate of everything. Maintaining a few duplicate values for comparison is feasible if the algorithm enables it.

> 以某种无法更改的位置或方式维护数据元素的冗余副本，可以检测到错误的数据值。当提出正确性问题时，可以将该值与不可更改的副本进行比较；如果它们不匹配，则有一个是错误的。但这在很多情况下是不切实际的。根据应用程序算法，您可能事先不知道要为哪些数据保存不可更改的副本。不保存不可更改副本的一个更实际的原因是存储所有副本所需的内存量。如果算法允许，则保留一些重复值进行比较是可行的。

Another way of storing redundant information is to compute some aggregate value based on the data being checked. For example, in a structure that contains a number of integers the system can sum them. This is the mechanism employed in the Space Shuttle avionics to determine if command signals sent from multiple processors are correct. \[Skl76\] This works if the ordering of the values within the structure is insignificant. But if the ordering of the values has meaning then summing the elements won’t work, since addition is commutative. They might sum to the same value even though the addends (the data being checked) has changed.

> 存储冗余信息的另一种方法是基于正在检查的数据计算一些聚合值。例如，在包含多个整数的结构中，系统可以对它们求和。这是航天飞机航空电子设备中用来确定从多个处理器发送的命令信号是否正确的机制\[Skl76\]如果结构中的值的顺序无关紧要，则此方法有效。但如果值的排序有意义，那么求和元素就不起作用，因为加法是可交换的。即使加数（被检查的数据）发生了变化，它们的总和也可能是相同的值。

![equation](./OEBPS/images/130-1.gif)

A more sophisticated kind of redundant data is a checksum which is computed in a way that avoids the problem just mentioned. For it to be useful, it should be computed in a way that data values can be uniquely checked. The purpose of the checksum is to increase confidence that the data is being checked. Going backwards from the checksum to the original data is not required.

> 一种更复杂的冗余数据是校验和，它的计算方式可以避免刚才提到的问题。为了使其有用，应该以可以唯一检查数据值的方式计算它。校验和的目的是增加正在检查数据的信心。不需要从校验和返回到原始数据。

A simple example of a checksum to detect errors is the use of parity. The parity bit serves as a flag that the data it is watching has changed. Parity only detects the error. The concept is extended in ERROR CORRECTING CODES (57) by adding additional information that will enable the erroneous data to be corrected.

> 校验和检测错误的一个简单示例是使用奇偶校验。奇偶校验位用作它正在监视的数据已经改变的标志。奇偶校验仅检测错误。在纠错码（57）中，通过添加将使错误数据得以纠正的附加信息来扩展该概念。

Hashing algorithms such as SHA, MD5 and others are used in many places to compute a checksum over a block of information to identify whether it altered either accidentally or maliciously. Hashing functions can be used to enhance fault tolerance by checking data that is received over transmission lines, or data that is stored on the system.

> 哈希算法，如 SHA、MD5 和其他算法，在许多地方被用来计算一个信息块的校验和，以识别它是意外更改还是恶意更改。散列函数可用于通过检查通过传输线接收的数据或存储在系统上的数据来增强容错能力。

As an example, the 4ESS™ Switch uses hashing algorithms to serve as checksums on memory images stored on disk. Additional hash based checksums are used to ensure that the stored hash values are themselves stored correctly. Periodic ROUTINE AUDITS (24) compute the checksum of system memory. If the checksum does not match the stored value the region of memory is reloaded from disk storage.

> 例如，4ESS™ Switch 使用哈希算法作为存储在磁盘上的内存映像的校验和。使用其他基于哈希的校验和来确保存储的哈希值本身正确存储。定期例行审计（24）计算系统内存的校验和。如果校验和与存储值不匹配，则将从磁盘存储重新加载内存区域。

Message checksums, such as the IPv4 header checksum, only help the system know if the message was transmitted correctly. It does not indicate whether the data that was initially sent was correct.

> 消息校验和（如 IPv4 报头校验和）只能帮助系统知道消息是否正确传输。它不指示最初发送的数据是否正确。

Therefore,

> 因此

**Add a checksum to the data value, or over the block of data, <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.44" id="c05.htm#fig5.44a">Figure 44</a>. The CHECKSUM’S value is an indicator of whether the data is correct or not.**

When the data watched by a checksum is altered during normal operation it is important to recompute the checksum. Periodically recomputing CHECKSUMS for static data serves both as a validity audit and removes errors that might have been introduced into the checksum itself.

# 26. Riding Over Transients

![](./OEBPS/images/132-1.jpg)

… The system is in an environment where there are many potential errors that can occur and faults that might activate. Not all of them cause permanent failures. Transient faults and errors will disappear autonomously over time. Imagine a stretch of road where there are many bumps; each bump affects your vehicle for only a moment and then is gone. Lightning striking power or telephone poles can send a transient surge of electricity over the lines that all connected systems need to ride through, but the surge will disappear.

> …系统所处的环境中可能会出现许多潜在错误和可能激活的故障。并非所有这些都会导致永久性故障。瞬时故障和错误将随时间自动消失。想象一段有很多颠簸的道路；每一次颠簸只会影响你的车辆片刻，然后就消失了。雷击电源或电线杆会在所有连接系统都需要通过的线路上发出短暂的电涌，但电涌会消失。

Error processing may ESCALATE (9) through successively more dramatic recovery strategies until it finds the right one, the one that masks or corrects the error.

> 错误处理可以通过连续的更戏剧性的恢复策略来升级（9），直到找到正确的恢复策略，即屏蔽或纠正错误的策略。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

**How can the system avoid wasting resources processing transient errors that won’t have a long term effect on the system?**

> **系统如何避免浪费资源处理不会对系统产生长期影响的瞬时错误**

Many times the first signs of an error are not the true signatures of the error. The first appearances of a situation might appear like something different.

> 很多时候，错误的最初迹象并不是错误的真正特征。一种情况的第一次出现可能看起来有所不同。

‘Patience is a virtue’ to allow the true signature of an error to show itself.

> “耐心是一种美德”，可以让错误的真正特征显现出来。

You want the system to be able to detect errors and failures as quickly as possible so that processing can begin. Premature error processing can result in taking incorrect actions.

> 您希望系统能够尽快检测错误和故障，以便开始处理。过早的错误处理可能导致采取错误的操作。

You need to consider the possibility of transient errors during the design phase. The classic example of errors working themselves out is a lightning strike or a static electric discharge. A static electric discharge might cause a momentary error, but then its effects can totally disappear. Some other examples of transient errors are the noise on a signal bus or an alpha particle that toggles a bit.

> 您需要在设计阶段考虑瞬态错误的可能性。解决错误的典型例子是雷击或静电放电。静电放电可能会导致瞬时误差，但其影响可能会完全消失。瞬态误差的其他一些例子是信号总线上的噪声或切换一位的阿尔法粒子。

The system should not waste time processing transient errors. There are more useful tasks to be completed. If a disk read returns with a parity error, repeating the read operation will succeed if the cause of the parity error was transient.

> 系统不应浪费时间处理瞬时错误。还有更多有用的任务需要完成。如果磁盘读取返回奇偶校验错误，如果奇偶校验错误的原因是暂时的，则重复读取操作将成功。

Errors have signatures that can be identified by FAULT CORRELATION (12). Combinations of effects seen when the error occurs enables them to be categorized. Signatures for errors that result from transient faults can be determined in advance and then used to determine if the error should be tolerated briefly because it is a transient, or if immediate action should be taken.

> 错误具有可通过故障相关性（12）识别的特征。错误发生时所看到的效果的组合使它们能够被分类。可以预先确定瞬时故障导致的错误的特征，然后使用该特征来确定是否应短暂容忍错误，因为它是瞬时的，或者是否应立即采取行动。

The length of time that an error or failure should be tolerated before error processing is initiated depends on the context. In situations where the error might easily propagate to other parts of the system, for example by corrupting data, the number of errors that are tolerated should be low. In other situations, such as web requests, many faults should be tolerated before error processing is initiated because the nature of the request is unreliable.

> 在启动错误处理之前，应容忍错误或失败的时间长度取决于上下文。在错误可能容易传播到系统的其他部分的情况下，例如通过损坏数据，可以容忍的错误数量应该很低。在其他情况下，例如 web 请求，在启动错误处理之前，应该容忍许多错误，因为请求的性质是不可靠的。

Therefore,

> 因此

**Monitor the system and conduct FAULT CORRELATION (12) when errors occur. The system should begin error processing immediately if the error or failure is not one of those identified in advance as being transient. If the correlation indicates that it might be from a transient fault, monitor the frequency of occurrence but take no other action unless it is occurring more than expected, <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.45" id="c05.htm#fig5.45a">Figure 45</a>.**

> **监控系统并在发生错误时进行故障关联（12）。如果错误或故障不是预先识别为暂时的错误或故障之一，系统应立即开始错误处理。如果相关性表明其可能来自瞬时故障，则监控发生频率，但不采取其他措施，除非发生频率超过预期，<a href=“#c05.htm#fig5.45”id=“c05.htm#fig5.45a”> 图 45</a>**

![](./OEBPS/images/133-1.jpg)

If many messages are arriving that all exhibit the characteristics of faulty messages, the threshold for RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS must be very short to avoid filling buffers completely full of faulty messages. The risk of propagation during the threshold delay must be weighed against the effort to process a transient error that might not be present by the time the processing logic tries to isolate it.

> 如果到达的许多消息都表现出故障消息的特征，则跨越传输的阈值必须非常短，以避免将缓冲区完全填满故障消息。阈值延迟期间的传播风险必须与处理瞬时错误的努力进行权衡，该瞬时错误在处理逻辑尝试隔离时可能不存在。

Note that there are three cases identified here. Some errors and failures that are detected are clearly not transient and error processing should begin immediately. Of the errors and failures that might be the result of a transient fault, if they are occurring with a low frequency, error processing should wait until either another non-transient error occurs or the frequency of the errors or failures increases to unacceptable levels. The third case is where the frequency of a transient occurring exceeds a limit.

> 请注意，这里确定了三种情况。检测到的某些错误和故障显然不是瞬时的，错误处理应立即开始。在可能由瞬时故障导致的错误和故障中，如果这些错误和故障以较低的频率发生，错误处理应等待，直到发生另一个非瞬时错误或错误或故障的频率增加到不可接受的水平。第三种情况是瞬态发生的频率超过极限。

<img src="./OEBPS/images/3square.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />

Error processing is only done for non-transient errors and failures. This is more efficient in terms of system resources and supports higher availability.

> 仅对非瞬时错误和故障进行错误处理。这在系统资源方面更有效，并支持更高的可用性。

As an example, RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS can be lazily implemented by not checking the return code from disk writes. The assumption is that disks are inherently reliable. If the disk is operating correctly, the return code will identify it as such. If the disk has a permanent, non-transient error, then it has probably failed already and error processing will have prevented the attempt to write the disk at all. If the disk has a transient error, the code could be either success or failure; by not checking the code the system will ride over the transient.

> 例如，RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS 可以通过不检查磁盘写入的返回代码来实现。假设磁盘本质上是可靠的。如果磁盘运行正常，则返回代码将识别磁盘。如果磁盘出现永久性、非暂时性错误，那么它可能已经失败，错误处理将根本阻止写入磁盘的尝试。如果磁盘出现暂时错误，则代码可能是成功或失败；通过不检查代码，系统将越过瞬态。

At the other end of the spectrum web requests are inherently unreliable and so people do not wait very long to re-request a web page. If the request times out and they retry, they are riding over the transient network error, in this case ignoring that the error occurred. If every web page requested generates an error then permanent faults, such as DNS servers or proxies being out of service, are suspected. In these cases if the user has permission they will initiate error recovery or error mitigation to enable future requests to complete.

> 另一方面，web 请求本身就不可靠，因此人们不会等待很长时间来重新请求网页。如果请求超时并重试，则它们将跳过暂时的网络错误，在这种情况下，忽略发生的错误。如果请求的每个网页都会生成错误，则怀疑存在永久性故障，例如 DNS 服务器或代理服务器停止服务。在这些情况下，如果用户有权限，他们将启动错误恢复或错误缓解，以使将来的请求能够完成。

RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS is a combination of error detection and error processing. It is deciding that an error should not receive further, more intensive, processing. But regardless of whether the error in this case is determined to be a transient, it should be reported to the FAULT OBSERVER (10). Another part of the system with more information about system state might decide that this error that looks like a transient is not really a transient in this particular case and begin full blown error processing.

> RIDING OVER TRANSIENTS 是错误检测和错误处理的结合。它决定不对错误进行进一步、更密集的处理。但无论这种情况下的错误是否被确定为瞬态，都应将其报告给故障观察者（10）。具有更多系统状态信息的系统的另一部分可能会决定，在这种特定情况下，看起来像瞬态的错误实际上不是瞬态，并开始全面的错误处理。

The pattern LEAKY BUCKET COUNTERS (27) describes a very useful mechanism for monitoring a situation and only reacting when it has been determined to be non-transitory. You should set the leaky bucket’s drain threshold to the time interval within which the errors, if non-transient, will reoccur. You should set the overflow threshold to a number that indicates that you are sure that if the error/failure were transient they would not reoccur that many times. When overflow occurs, the system should initiate error processing immediately. If the bucket drains completely you know that it was a transient. …

> 模式泄漏铲斗计数器（27）描述了一种非常有用的机制，用于监测情况，并仅在确定其为非暂时性时作出反应。您应该将泄漏桶的排放阈值设置为错误（如果非瞬时）将再次出现的时间间隔。您应该将溢出阈值设置为一个数字，该数字表示您确信如果错误/故障是暂时的，它们不会重复出现那么多次。发生溢出时，系统应立即启动错误处理。如果桶完全排空，你就知道这是一个短暂的…

… You are designing a system that is intended to recognize and correct errors automatically.

> 并非所有错误都是如此重要，以至于第一次出现错误就刺激错误处理。

This pattern is ideal for systems that deal with transactions where it is acceptable to ignore, process incorrectly or even discard individual transactions. The flow of transactions might bring multiple errors that could be either transient or permanent. The system wants to smooth the error triggering process.

**How does the system know if an error is transient or intermittent?**

> **系统如何知道错误是暂时的还是间歇性的**

Not all faults are permanent. Sometimes transient faults occur that cause errors which can lead to failures. By their transitory nature they are difficult or impossible to isolate and correct. Examples of transient faults include signal crosstalk, static electric discharges, lightning strikes or intermittently broken keys on a keyboard. The component that reports the error might be an innocent victim of the transient. It shouldn’t be punished.

> 并非所有的故障都是永久性的。有时会发生瞬时故障，导致可能导致故障的错误。由于其短暂性，它们很难或不可能被隔离和纠正。瞬时故障的例子包括信号串扰、静电放电、雷击或键盘上的间歇性按键断裂。报告错误的组件可能是瞬态的无辜受害者。它不应该受到惩罚。

In many cases you are willing to allow a certain number of errors if they aren’t too close together. If they come too close together you want the system to trigger some sort of error processing action.

> 在许多情况下，如果它们不太靠近，您愿意允许一定数量的错误。如果它们太接近，您希望系统触发某种错误处理操作。

**Each UNIT OF MITIGATION (1) that is to be watched has a LEAKY BUCKET COUNTER. The counter receives a predetermined value when the system is first initialized. Whenever an error is detected the counter is incremented. Periodically the counter is decremented, but never beyond its initial value.**

> **要监视的每个缓解单元（1）都有一个泄漏铲斗计数器。当系统首次初始化时，计数器接收预定值。每当检测到错误时，计数器就会递增。计数器会定期递减，但不会超过其初始值**

**Exceeding a predetermined upper threshold means that the errors are occurring faster than acceptable and the errors should be considered to be permanent and not transient.**

> **超过预定的上限阈值意味着错误发生得比可接受的更快，并且错误应被认为是永久性的而不是暂时性的**

**Unless and until this happens the errors should be considered transient. See <a href="#c05.htm#fig5.46" id="c05.htm#fig5.46a">Figure 46</a>.**

A counter incrementing past a predetermined threshold value indicates that the rate of error or fault events exceeds the allowable rate (as defined by the empty or leak rate, the rate of errors and the threshold value).

> 递增超过预定阈值的计数器指示错误或故障事件的速率超过允许速率（由空或泄漏速率、错误速率和阈值定义）。

Applying this solution produces a system that can determine if an error is transient or permanent and react appropriately.

You must design the rate of emptying to a value that achieves the desired behavior. If the inflow of errors exactly equals the normal emptying then the system will reach a steady state and errors will not be reported. The steady state just mentioned indicates that the maximum number of allowable transients is being encountered. This maximum can be set (by changing the emptying rate) at design time, through configuration parameters or even through the system learning what a tolerable level of occurrence is.

> 您必须将排空率设计为能够实现所需行为的值。如果错误流入量恰好等于正常排空量，则系统将达到稳定状态，不会报告错误。刚刚提到的稳定状态表明遇到了最大数量的允许瞬变。该最大值可以在设计时通过配置参数或甚至通过系统学习可容忍的发生水平来设置（通过改变排空率）。

If the empty rate is too high then the system will never identify non-transient errors.

> 如果空速率太高，则系统将永远不会识别非瞬时错误。
