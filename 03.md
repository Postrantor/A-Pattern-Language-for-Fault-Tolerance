# CHAPTER 3

# Introduction to the Patterns

This chapter builds on the definitions of Chapter 1 and the Fault Tolerant Mindset of Chapter 2 to provide an introduction to the patterns. This includes information about the context that is assumed by, and is shared by, the patterns found in the later chapters.

> 本章以第 1 章的定义和第 2 章的容错心态为基础，对模式进行介绍。这包括关于上下文的信息，该上下文由后面章节中的模式假设并共享。

Four phases of fault tolerance describe the execution time lifecycle of a fault: **_error detection, error recovery, error mitigation_** and **_fault treatment_**. These are shown in <a href="#c03.htm#fig3.8" id="c03.htm#fig3.8a">Figure 8</a>. To be fault tolerant, the first thing that must happen when a fault activates and an error occurs is error detection. This can happen through a routine means such as an audit (checksum) check, or through special components that are designed to detect when an error has happened.

> 容错的四个阶段描述了故障的执行时间生命周期：**_错误检测、错误恢复、错误缓解_**和**_故障处理_**。这些如图 8</a>所示。要做到容错，当故障激活并发生错误时，必须首先进行错误检测。这可以通过常规方法（如审计（校验和）检查）或通过专门用于检测错误发生时间的特殊组件来实现。

Once detected the error must be processed, which is the focus of the next two phases. These phases are executed in real time and will affect the unavailability of the system. Error recovery works to substitute an error-free system state for the erroneous system state that was detected.

> 一旦检测到错误，必须进行处理，这是接下来两个阶段的重点。这些阶段是实时执行的，将影响系统的不可用性。错误恢复工作是将无错误的系统状态替换为检测到的错误系统状态。

In some cases the error can be removed, or mitigated, without transitioning to a different system state. For example when an erroneous data value can be corrected and processing can continue, as opposed to returning the system to the state from which it could attempt to recompute the data value correctly.

> 在某些情况下，可以消除或减轻错误，而无需转换到不同的系统状态。例如，当可以纠正错误的数据值并且可以继续处理时，而不是将系统返回到可以尝试正确重新计算数据值的状态。

Fault treatment is done last, and is the step in which the fault is removed from the system through software update or patching mechanisms. \[Lap91, pp 23–25\] Restoration of normal operation usually resumes before fault treatment begins.

> 故障处理是最后完成的，是通过软件更新或修补机制从系统中删除故障的步骤\[Lap91，第 23–25 页\]通常在故障处理开始之前恢复正常运行。

Chapters 5 through 8 focus on the four phases of fault tolerance. Chapter 5 addresses detection techniques. Chapters 6 and 7 cover error processing: Chapter 6 discusses error recovery techniques. Error mitigation is covered in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 discusses fault treatment techniques. Chapter 5 also contains error processing patterns that provide a foundation for those in Chapters 6 and 7. Chapter 4 focuses on architectural attributes of the system, those things that cut across the entire system.

> 第 5 章至第 8 章重点介绍容错的四个阶段。第 5 章介绍了检测技术。第 6 章和第 7 章介绍错误处理：第 6 章讨论错误恢复技术。第 7 章介绍了错误缓解，第 8 章讨论了故障处理技术。第 5 章还包含错误处理模式，为第 6 章和第 7 章中的错误处理模式提供了基础。第 4 章侧重于系统的体系结构属性，这些属性贯穿整个系统。

The patterns that follow discuss fault tolerance both to protect data from the effects of faults and to protect execution flows from faults. The choice of which technique is appropriate for any given design problem is based on the context of the problem and the system’s specifications.

> 下面的模式讨论了容错性，以保护数据免受故障影响，并保护执行流免受故障影响。对于任何给定的设计问题，选择哪种技术都是基于问题的背景和系统的规范。

# _Shared Context for These Patterns_

The shared context for these patterns includes the following attributes. Most of the patterns focus narrowly on the fault tolerance issue so that they are small enough and discrete enough that an individual developer or a small team can use them.

> 这些模式的共享上下文包括以下属性。大多数模式都狭隘地关注容错问题，因此它们足够小，足够分散，单个开发人员或小团队可以使用它们。

## Real-Time

The patterns apply to both soft and hard real-time systems. Soft real-time refers to systems that do not have functions that absolutely must occur at certain times or with specified frequency. Soft real-time systems have deadlines, but failure to satisfy a system deadline does not result in a catastrophic failure. The limits of acceptable variation due to system workload are described in the system’s requirements. An example of a soft real-time system is a web server. Responses are desired very quickly, but if a request should take longer than specified it won’t result in a system failure. On the other hand in a hard real-time system, such as an aircraft flight control system, there can be catastrophic consequences if a deadline is missed. Late results can have just as catastrophic an impact as a totally missed deadline. Hard real-time systems have much more stringent constraints that soft real-time systems. The fault tolerance techniques that should be employed in hard real-time systems are a superset of the ones in this book.

> 这些模式适用于软实时系统和硬实时系统。软实时是指不具有绝对必须在特定时间或特定频率发生的功能的系统。软实时系统有最后期限，但未能满足系统最后期限不会导致灾难性故障。系统需求中描述了由于系统工作负载而导致的可接受变化的极限。软实时系统的一个例子是 web 服务器。响应非常快，但如果请求所需时间超过指定时间，则不会导致系统故障。另一方面，在硬实时系统中，如飞机飞行控制系统，如果错过最后期限，可能会产生灾难性后果。迟到的结果可能会产生灾难性的影响，就像完全错过最后期限一样。硬实时系统具有比软实时系统更严格的约束。硬实时系统中应采用的容错技术是本书中的一个超集。

## High Reliability

The system will have stringent availability and correctness requirements.

> 系统将具有严格的可用性和正确性要求。

### _High Availability_

The systems should be available for service as much as possible. The system’s requirements will state the expectations of the customer for what percentage of the time the system will be available.

> 系统应尽可能可供使用。系统要求将说明客户对系统可用时间百分比的期望。

### _Failure Rate Requirements_

The system has requirements for acceptable failure rates, such as ‘only 1 in 100 000 transactions may be dropped or otherwise mishandled’. These requirements define the needed accuracy of the results and when taken together with the unavailability requirements define the dependability requirements of the system. In some cases the requirements will be very stringent to avoid catastrophic failures, for example the failure of the navigational control system in an aircraft is a serious matter that must be avoided. In some cases, the requirements for accuracy will not be as stringent.

> 该系统对可接受的故障率有要求，例如“只有十万分之一的事务可能被丢弃或处理不当”。这些要求定义了结果所需的准确性，当与不可用性要求一起使用时，定义了系统的可靠性要求。在某些情况下，要求将非常严格，以避免灾难性故障，例如，飞机导航控制系统的故障是必须避免的严重问题。在某些情况下，对精度的要求不会那么严格。

## State or Stateless

The _state_ of the system is the combination of local variables, execution location (i.e. the program counter), and workload status that describes what the system is doing at any specific instance. A system’s state information may be stored internally, in memory or externally, in a file system or database. Systems that have only small amounts of state information have different needs for recovery techniques than do systems that keep large amounts of state information.

> 系统的_state_是本地变量、执行位置（即程序计数器）和工作负载状态的组合，它们描述了系统在任何特定实例中的操作。系统的状态信息可以存储在内部、存储器或外部的文件系统或数据库中。只有少量状态信息的系统对恢复技术的需求与保留大量状态信息的不同。

Web servers provide an example of stateless systems. Requests arrive at the server, are processed and then they are no longer part of the system. An individual operating system command that starts and completes in a short time is another example of a stateless command.

> Web 服务器提供了无状态系统的示例。请求到达服务器，被处理，然后它们不再是系统的一部分。在短时间内启动和完成的单个操作系统命令是无状态命令的另一个示例。

The public switched telephone network provides an example of a stateful system, one with a large amount of state information. Call requests arrive over time, require information to be exchanged with other systems, and some state must be preserved for the duration of the telephone call. Systems with operations that take considerable time are usually stateful. A computer’s operating system is an example of a stateful system because it manages information on behalf of its applications. When a stateful system loses state it loses its ability to continue its processing.

> 公共交换电话网络提供了一个具有大量状态信息的有状态系统的例子。呼叫请求随时间到达，需要与其他系统交换信息，并且在电话呼叫期间必须保留某些状态。操作耗时较长的系统通常是有状态的。计算机的操作系统是有状态系统的一个例子，因为它代表应用程序管理信息。当有状态系统失去状态时，它就失去了继续处理的能力。

There are patterns in this book that address the needs of both stateless or stateful systems. Some patterns, such as CHECKPOINT (37) are more appropriate to systems with state information. Other patterns such as FRESH WORK BEFORE STALE (55) are well suited to systems with only a little state information. Other patterns apply in either case.

> 本书中有一些模式可以满足无状态或有状态系统的需求。一些模式，如 CHECKPOINT（37），更适用于具有状态信息的系统。其他模式，如 FRESH WORK BEFORE STALE（55），非常适合只有少量状态信息的系统。其他模式适用于这两种情况。

## External Observers

Fault tolerant systems have observers and monitors, either operating personnel or other computer systems that watch the systems for errors and failures. Information about all detected errors and failures and any actions taken to compensate for them is a basic requirement on the system. Sometimes DECORATORS \[GHJ+95\] and FACADES \[GHJ+95\] are used to wrap entities that do not and cannot be made to report. Some system’s observers are interested in real-time data, for example spacecraft launch telemetry. Some system’s observers are only interested in obtaining reports periodically, such as when an automobile’s control computer is checked at the repair shop.

> 容错系统具有观察员和监视器，无论是操作人员还是其他计算机系统，都可以监视系统的错误和故障。有关所有检测到的错误和故障以及为补偿这些错误和故障而采取的任何措施的信息是系统的基本要求。有时，解码器\[GHJ+95\]和 FACADES\[GHJ+95\]用于包装没有也不能报告的实体。一些系统的观察员对实时数据感兴趣，例如航天器发射遥测。一些系统的观察者只对定期获取报告感兴趣，例如在修理厂检查汽车的控制计算机时。

## Integrated Fault Tolerance

The system capabilities discussed in these patterns sit on top of the application-required functionality and are orthogonal in many ways to the primary functioning of the system. For example, the parts that control recovery from errors could be used for many different applications, and similarly the application could work with many recovery processes and methods.

> 这些模式中讨论的系统功能位于应用程序所需功能之上，并且在许多方面与系统的主要功能正交。例如，控制从错误中恢复的部分可以用于许多不同的应用程序，类似地，应用程序可以使用许多恢复过程和方法。

Talking about the fault tolerance concepts as though they are separate parts of the system simplifies the discussion, but in practice they are integrated with the application. Some programming paradigms, such as Aspect Oriented Programming, recognize the fact that the fault tolerance capabilities are orthogonal to the main application functionality. These support adding fault tolerant capabilities to the system in the form of cross-cutting aspects. In traditional programming paradigms the fault tolerance activities are merged with other capabilities. The patterns in this book do not presuppose or require either of these paradigms.

> 将容错概念视为系统的独立部分来讨论可以简化讨论，但实际上它们与应用程序集成在一起。一些编程范例，如面向方面编程，认识到容错能力与主要应用程序功能正交的事实。这些支持以交叉方面的形式向系统添加容错功能。在传统编程范例中，容错活动与其他功能合并。本书中的模式并不预设或要求任何一种范式。

## Fault Tolerance is Not Free

Achieving fault tolerance and maintaining a state of readiness to handle errors and failures when they occur is not free. You should expect to be using more development resources than you would use for a non-fault tolerant project. At execution time, some resources will be dedicated to keeping the system fault tolerant. In some systems, processor time will be used to monitor the system. In other situations, extra memory will be required to store duplicate copies of data. The system’s requirements and operational profiles will help the system’s engineers to determine what extra resources are required.

> 实现容错并在错误和故障发生时保持处理错误和故障的就绪状态不是免费的。您应该期望使用比非容错项目更多的开发资源。在执行时，一些资源将专用于保持系统容错。在某些系统中，处理器时间将用于监控系统。在其他情况下，需要额外的内存来存储重复的数据副本。系统的需求和操作概要将帮助系统工程师确定需要哪些额外资源。

## Long Lived Systems

Systems that are designed and built to be fault tolerant have a longer life than other systems. For one reason, they don’t fail in ways that prompt their replacement. Another reason is that they are costlier to build. This extra expense causes their owners to want to protect their investment by keeping the system for a long time.

> 设计和构建为容错的系统比其他系统寿命更长。出于一个原因，它们不会以促使更换的方式失败。另一个原因是它们的建造成本更高。这一额外费用导致其所有者希望通过长期保留系统来保护其投资。

# _Terminology_

You are building a _system_ that consists of hardware and software _components_. Implementation of these components might use _modules_, or some other mechanism, such as _classes._ The system is being built to provide some _application_ functionality. Some functions not directly related to the application functionality, for example fault tolerance, will also be present in the system.

> 您正在构建一个由硬件和软件组件组成的_system_。这些组件的实现可能使用_modules_或其他机制，例如_classes 该系统的构建旨在提供一些应用程序功能。一些与应用程序功能不直接相关的功能，例如容错，也将出现在系统中。

In addition to using the application functionality, people interact with the system by executing _procedures_. Procedures are sequences of human-computer interaction steps.

> 除了使用应用程序功能外，人们还通过执行_processures_与系统交互。程序是人机交互步骤的序列。

Within a software component, there are _tasks_ that are executing on a _unit_ of some kind. The unit might refer to hardware or software entities, or it might mean a small logical corner of the system. The term ‘task’ is used here to denote an element of computation that could be the single program in a microcontroller, or a process or a thread or any other way of grouping execution time into specific application functionality.

> 在软件组件中，有_tasks_在某种类型的_unit_上执行。该单元可能指的是硬件或软件实体，也可能意味着系统的一个小逻辑角落。术语“任务”在这里用于表示计算元素，该计算元素可以是微控制器中的单个程序、进程或线程或将执行时间分组为特定应用程序功能的任何其他方式。

When the software component and all of its tasks are executing the application that the system was designed to perform, and there are no errors changing the execution and no special fault tolerance code is executing, the component is said to be engaged in its _normal_ processing.

> 当软件组件及其所有任务正在执行系统设计要执行的应用程序，并且没有错误改变执行，也没有特殊的容错代码正在执行时，该组件被称为正在进行其正常处理。

The correctness of _computational results_ is examined to determine if errors are present. These results might be either the numerical results of a computation or the side effects of such a computation or even the results of some action triggered by the system.

> 检查计算结果的正确性以确定是否存在错误。这些结果可能是计算的数值结果，也可能是这种计算的副作用，甚至是系统触发的某些动作的结果。

The system you are building is in a community of some kind with other elements that are its peers. The community might be a large scale _network_ such as the internet, where the individual systems are widely distributed geographically and may not be homogeneous. At the other end the system that employs these techniques might be different processor cores in the same silicon package.

> 您正在构建的系统是一个具有其他对等元素的社区。社区可能是一个大规模的网络，例如互联网，其中各个系统在地理上分布广泛，可能不是同质的。在另一端，采用这些技术的系统可能是同一硅封装中的不同处理器内核。
